1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,449.5,450.5, This file was created.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,450.5,451.5, Index.html.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,451.5,453.5, Which is very natural.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,453.5,456.5, Because I have opened this folder in VS code.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,456.5,458.5, Because I have opened this folder in VS code.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,458.5,460.5, This file is also made here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,460.5,461.5, I will make another file here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,461.5,463.5, I will make a file called this.txt.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,463.5,465.5, I will write this is this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,465.5,466.5, So what will happen?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,466.5,467.5, This file will also be created here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,467.5,468.5, You can see.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,468.5,471.5, So this folder and this VS code are both in sync.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,471.5,473.5, Now I will open this file from here with notepad.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,473.5,474.5, And I will show you.

1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,477.5,478.5, That is also my wish.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,478.5,480.5, But I will not use notepad.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,480.5,483.5, Because there are some things in VS code that do not give me notepad.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,483.5,486.5, And I want me to get those features.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,486.5,488.5, I do not want to overrun you.

1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,493.5,494.5, If I write here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,494.5,495.5, Hit html.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,495.5,499.5," If I hit enter, it automatically gives me the opening closing tag."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,499.5,501.5, If I hit the exclamation mark here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,501.5,503.5, It gives me a boilerplate template.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,503.5,507.5," If I click on this, then see the basic code of html came here."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,507.5,509.5, We will discuss about this later.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,509.5,511.5, You do not get overwhelmed at all.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,511.5,513.5, But as I want to tell you that.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,513.5,516.5, What kind of profit did this VS code get?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,516.5,518.5, Why did we not use notepad or VS code?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,518.5,519.5, And this feels.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,519.5,520.5, It feels so good.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,520.5,522.5, It feels like a developer.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,522.5,523.5, It feels like a hacker.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,523.5,524.5, That feel is also important.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,524.5,526.5, Then there will be a confidence to do coding.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,526.5,528.5, Now for Mac and Linux users.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,528.5,532.5, I want to comment on something exactly similar for you.

1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,534.5,536.5, I cannot use 3 laptops.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,536.5,537.5," Linux, Mac and windows 3."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,537.5,539.5, I cannot use them all together.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,539.5,541.5, So exactly the same things will remain for you.

1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,593.5,594.5, If I press caps lock.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,594.5,595.5, Then it will click caps lock here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,595.5,598.5, So you will know when I pressed any button.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,598.5,601.5, Now this thing is not relevant for you.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,601.5,603.5, But I just want to tell you that.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,603.5,604.5, Screencast mode.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,604.5,606.5, Screencast mode.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,606.5,609.5, We can change its settings from here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,609.5,612.5, Now here you see the vertical offset of screencast mode.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,612.5,613.5, What does vertical offset mean?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,613.5,615.5, If I zero the vertical offset.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,615.5,616.5, Then it is up.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,616.5,618.5, If I set vertical offset to 70.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,618.5,619.5, Then it is down.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,619.5,621.5, I will set it to 60.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,621.5,622.5, If I set it to 60.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,622.5,624.5, If I set it to 80.

1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,626.5,628.5, From bottom.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,628.5,629.5, How much will it look up.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,629.5,630.5, I have set it to zero.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,630.5,632.5, In fact I have set it to one.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,632.5,633.5, Now I will type anything.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,633.5,634.5, I have set it to this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,634.5,635.5, It will look down.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,635.5,636.5, Which is ideal.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,636.5,638.5, So I will close this.txt file.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,638.5,640.5, I will close the settings tab.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,640.5,641.5, These are tabs.

1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,643.5,645.5, They are tabs exactly.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,645.5,647.5, So I hope you have understood what it is.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,647.5,649.5, What we have written about it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,649.5,650.5, I have forgotten.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,650.5,651.5, I will tell you step by step.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,651.5,653.5, Exactly what is it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,653.5,655.5, You can also close the welcome page of VS Code.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,655.5,658.5, By any chance if you are zooming in VS Code.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,658.5,659.5, Which I will do.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,659.5,660.5, Because I am recording video.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,660.5,661.5, Add control plus.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,661.5,662.5, Add numpad plus.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,662.5,663.5, Look down.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,663.5,664.5, I have shown you.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,664.5,665.5, I am zooming in.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,665.5,667.5, I am zooming in because I am recording videos.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,667.5,669.5, So ideally I want you to see from the side.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,669.5,671.5, But when I am coding.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,671.5,673.5, I don't zoom in that much.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,673.5,674.5, So you have to keep this in mind.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,674.5,676.5, So these are related things from VS Code.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,676.5,680.5, I want to tell you how websites work.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,680.5,684.5, A website basically works through three types of people.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,684.5,685.5, Imagine three people.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,685.5,687.5, One is Client.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,687.5,688.5, One is Server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,688.5,690.5, Who is Client?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,690.5,691.5, Who is the second?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,691.5,692.5, Server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,692.5,693.5, Who is the third?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,693.5,694.5, Browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,694.5,696.5, Who is also called Babu.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,696.5,698.5, Browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,698.5,699.5, So Browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,699.5,700.5, Client.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,700.5,701.5, Server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,701.5,702.5, What is this Client?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,702.5,703.5, What is this Server?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,703.5,704.5, Client who me?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,704.5,705.5, You.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,705.5,706.5, We all.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,706.5,708.5, Who is the browser?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,708.5,709.5, Who is the browser?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,709.5,710.5, This is Chrome.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,710.5,711.5, Hello Chrome.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,711.5,712.5, I am Client.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,712.5,713.5, I will tell you from Client.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,713.5,714.5, When I write codewithherry.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,714.5,716.5, Suppose I write codewithherry.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,716.5,718.5, So basically what I say?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,718.5,721.5, I say from this browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,721.5,724.5," That by doing this, give me codewithherry.com website."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,724.5,727.5, Or if I write here youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,727.5,730.5, I say give me youtube.com website.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,730.5,731.5, I say browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,731.5,733.5, Give me youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,733.5,736.5, I want to watch youtube.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,736.5,738.5, Browser says you want youtube.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,738.5,739.5, Take it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,739.5,742.5, So I will enter youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,742.5,745.5, So from server.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,745.5,746.5, Bring youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,746.5,747.5, Do you understand?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,747.5,749.5, From server.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,749.5,750.5, Bring youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,750.5,753.5, He passed it and showed me this screen.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,753.5,755.5, This work happened so fast.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,755.5,759.5, Because my internet.com is very fast.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,759.5,760.5, It is so less.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,760.5,762.5, Nowadays people are faster.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,762.5,764.5, But still according to my locality.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,764.5,765.5, It is very fast.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,765.5,767.5, So with this fast internet speed.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,767.5,770.5, All these things are very fast.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,770.5,773.5, So Client server sends a request through browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,773.5,775.5, Browser is my assistant.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,775.5,777.5, I will do the same with browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,777.5,781.5, It will help me to bring this web page from server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,781.5,782.5, Who is managing the server?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,782.5,785.5, They are managing the server of youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,785.5,786.5, They are managing the server of youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,786.5,788.5, And there is some code written in that server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,788.5,791.5, Which sends me this kind of code.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,791.5,792.5, When I write youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,792.5,793.5, This code came.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,793.5,795.5, How to convert this code into this?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,795.5,796.5, This is for browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,796.5,798.5, Which means how to show me this?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,798.5,799.5, This is for browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,799.5,801.5, So Client browser says something like this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,801.5,803.5, What's give me youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,803.5,806.5, Browser says what's you want youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,806.5,807.5, Wait.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,807.5,808.5, I will ask youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,808.5,810.5, Then browser goes to server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,810.5,812.5, Means it requests server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,812.5,814.5, It says give me youtube.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,814.5,816.5, The server will give it here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,816.5,817.5, It will say here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,817.5,818.5, It will say here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,818.5,819.5, Error.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,819.5,820.5, It will say server error.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,820.5,821.5, It didn't get it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,821.5,822.5, Whatever the response is.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,822.5,824.5, Ideally it should be 200.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,824.5,825.5, The response code is 200.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,825.5,827.5, With that response.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,827.5,830.5, Which is our browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,830.5,831.5, It comes back to client.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,831.5,832.5, And shows this kind of page.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,832.5,833.5, I hope you have cleared it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,833.5,835.5, Client browser server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,835.5,836.5, Okay.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,836.5,837.5, So Client browser has.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,837.5,838.5, Browser has.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,838.5,839.5, Browser has.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,839.5,840.5, Back to browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,840.5,841.5, Client has.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,841.5,842.5, So this is how it works.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,842.5,843.5, This is a little more important.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,843.5,844.5, Let me tell you once more.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,844.5,845.5, When you write google.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,845.5,846.5, On any website.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,846.5,847.5, Google.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,847.5,848.5, So client.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,848.5,849.5, It says give me google.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,849.5,850.5, Browser says.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,850.5,851.5, Guru dev.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,851.5,852.5, You want google.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,852.5,853.5, Wait.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,853.5,854.5, I will give you server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,854.5,855.5, So browser goes to server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,855.5,856.5, And it gets google.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,856.5,857.5, And it gives you.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,857.5,858.5, You get google.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,858.5,859.5, Now with google.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,859.5,860.5," All the images, videos, whatever it is."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,860.5,861.5, All these things are sent.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,861.5,862.5, These icons.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,862.5,863.5, All these things are sent.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,863.5,864.5, These icons.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,864.5,865.5, These icons.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,865.5,866.5, The URL of these icons is also written in this code.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,866.5,867.5, And that too.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,867.5,868.5, The browser works.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,868.5,869.5, It displays us correctly.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,869.5,870.5, So the server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,870.5,871.5, It is a very good thing.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,871.5,872.5, It is very good.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,872.5,873.5, It is very good.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,873.5,874.5, It displays us easily.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,874.5,875.5, So the server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,875.5,877.5, It sends the browser a bundle.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,877.5,878.5, It sends a bundle like this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,878.5,879.5, And passing this bundle.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,879.5,881.5, It shows us this way.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,881.5,882.5, It works as a browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,882.5,884.5, Now whatever further interaction.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,884.5,885.5, The user.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,885.5,886.5, With this page.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,886.5,887.5, The browser will get additional requests.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,887.5,889.5, If I write and inspect.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,889.5,890.5, And then go to network.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,890.5,891.5, And here I write.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,891.5,892.5, Suppose.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,892.5,893.5, Harry brother.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,893.5,894.5, I wrote Harry brother.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,894.5,895.5, So look at all the requests.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,895.5,896.5, For images.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,896.5,897.5, And also all the requests.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,897.5,898.5, So as you interact.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,898.5,899.5, As you interact.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,899.5,900.5, As you interact.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,900.5,901.5, As you interact.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,901.5,902.5, And you have to send additional requests.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,902.5,903.5, To the browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,903.5,904.5, So by combining.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,904.5,906.5, You can consider it as a restaurant.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,906.5,907.5, You have given an order.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,907.5,908.5, That is on the request page.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,908.5,909.5, You have given an order.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,909.5,910.5, You have taken an order.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,910.5,911.5, A waiter took it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,911.5,913.5, The waiter went to the kitchen.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,913.5,915.5, He sent it to your order.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,915.5,916.5, You consider the kitchen as a server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,916.5,917.5, And finally.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,917.5,919.5, When the kitchen gave the order.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,919.5,921.5, So what did this waiter do.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,921.5,923.5, Which is working as a browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,923.5,925.5, The waiter saw you.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,925.5,926.5, Order again.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,926.5,928.5, It is possible that the order.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,928.5,929.5, Can not be made in the kitchen.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,929.5,930.5, For some reason.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,930.5,931.5, It is very less.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,931.5,932.5, Order again.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,932.5,933.5, And you did not get it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,933.5,934.5, But it happens sometimes.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,934.5,935.5, Similarly here also sometimes happens.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,935.5,936.5, This error is seen.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,936.5,937.5, 4 not 4 error.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,937.5,938.5, Or 500 error.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,938.5,940.5, The server is not working.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,940.5,941.5, Such an error.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,941.5,942.5, So such an error is seen.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,942.5,943.5, Whenever you see.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,943.5,944.5, Even then it is told to you.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,944.5,946.5, But ideally 200.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,946.5,948.5, That is the response of OK.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,948.5,950.5, And you get such a web page.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,950.5,952.5, So you can consider it as a restaurant.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,952.5,953.5, So whenever you write.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,953.5,954.5, Google.com slash mail.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,954.5,956.5, So if Google.com slash mail is available.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,956.5,957.5, Then you will see.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,957.5,958.5, And if you write.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,958.5,959.5, Code with any.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,959.5,960.5, Contact.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,960.5,961.5, If it is available.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,961.5,962.5, Then you will see.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,962.5,963.5, If it is not available.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,963.5,964.5, Then 4 not 4.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,964.5,965.5, Or 500 error.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,965.5,966.5, So you will see a 500 page.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,966.5,967.5, You will see.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,967.5,968.5, Whatever server will send.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,968.5,970.5, So this cycle is going on.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,970.5,972.5, The client sent me a request.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,972.5,973.5, The browser sent the server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,973.5,976.5, The server then processed the request.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,976.5,978.5, After that the server sent the browser.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,978.5,979.5, Data again.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,979.5,980.5, And whatever data sent.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,980.5,981.5, The browser showed the client.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,981.5,983.5, Then the client did something.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,983.5,985.5, The browser sent the same request to the server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,985.5,986.5, Then the server sent something.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,986.5,987.5, Whatever data the server sent.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,987.5,989.5, The client returned it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,989.5,990.5, And so on.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,990.5,991.5, So now you will say.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,991.5,992.5, All this is fine.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,992.5,993.5, But what is the backend?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,993.5,994.5, What is the backend?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,994.5,995.5, What does the backend mean?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,995.5,998.5, The backend is how the server is processing the request.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,998.5,1001.5, Now if you believe that you have a blog.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1001.5,1003.5, There is a lot of data in the blog.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1003.5,1004.5, So what will you do?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1004.5,1007.5, You will store every web page of the blog separately.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1007.5,1009.5, Or you will generate that content dynamically.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1009.5,1012.5, You will generate that content dynamically.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1012.5,1013.5, I will take an example of Google.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1013.5,1015.5, If I search here Harry by.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1015.5,1016.5, So you can see here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1016.5,1017.5, You can see that Google's header.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1017.5,1019.5, These are the links.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1019.5,1021.5, This format does not change at all.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1021.5,1023.5, If I write here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1023.5,1024.5, Shubham.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1024.5,1026.5, I have written Shubham here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1026.5,1028.5, So here as soon as I write Shubham.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1028.5,1029.5, Now see.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1029.5,1030.5, When I wrote Harry by.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1030.5,1033.5, I am showing the very similar content of it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1033.5,1034.5, So what does Google do?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1034.5,1035.5, The server of Google.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1035.5,1036.5, The backend.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1036.5,1043.5, The backend processes the data in a way that it can send it for this kind of HTML corresponding query.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1043.5,1044.5, That is when you write Shubham.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1044.5,1045.5, Then send it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1045.5,1046.5, When I write Harry by.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1046.5,1047.5, So send this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1047.5,1050.5, So the way to generate this thing.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1050.5,1053.5, That is the backend through which system it is.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1053.5,1055.5, Now this backend can be Django.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1055.5,1056.5, This backend can be Flask.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1056.5,1057.5, This backend can be Node.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1057.5,1059.5, This backend can be PHP.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1059.5,1061.5, This backend can be Ruby on Rails.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1061.5,1064.5, And the data in the backend is used.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1064.5,1066.5, The backend code is not visible to the client.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1066.5,1069.5, This is the front end code that sends the server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1069.5,1071.5, And how did the server make this code?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1071.5,1072.5, We do not know this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1072.5,1073.5, Because this is running on the server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1073.5,1076.5," If you are confused, then do not be confused."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1076.5,1077.5, You will understand all these things.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1077.5,1079.5, We will see the backend in the future.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1079.5,1082.5, Now we understand how the front end works.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1082.5,1086.5, The front end is made primarily with three languages.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1086.5,1089.5," HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1089.5,1092.5, These are the three languages that you need.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1092.5,1093.5, If you are making a website.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1093.5,1095.5," Every website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1095.5,1097.5," In most of the cases, it is needed."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1097.5,1102.5," If you use only HTML, then it becomes a very basic skeleton of the website."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1102.5,1105.5," After that, when you use CSS, you can style it."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1105.5,1107.5," The way this button is visible,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1107.5,1109.5, then only CSS is visible.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1109.5,1111.5," Along with that, this button is red."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1111.5,1113.5, This button is curve like this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1113.5,1115.5, This is all thanks to CSS.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1115.5,1117.5, The edges are visible here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1117.5,1119.5, This is all thanks to CSS.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1119.5,1122.5," So, the CSS works is to style a page."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1122.5,1125.5, What color and what will be the color of the button.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1125.5,1127.5, All these works are done through CSS.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1127.5,1130.5, There is a beauty of CSS.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1130.5,1134.5, HTML is a very basic page.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1134.5,1137.5, This is a standard that is agreed.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1137.5,1139.5," Anyone who makes a website, will make it on HTML."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1139.5,1142.5, So that the browser can understand how to parse.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1142.5,1145.5, The browser works is to parse HTML.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1145.5,1148.5, And HTML is a skeleton.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1148.5,1149.5, This is a standard.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1149.5,1152.5, Anyone who makes a website in this world will make it on HTML.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1152.5,1153.5, The skeleton will use HTML.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1153.5,1154.5, This is a standard.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1154.5,1159.5, This is a standard that is made so that everyone makes the same kind of pages.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1159.5,1162.5," If someone is making a browser, then you have to parse the same language."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1162.5,1167.5," If you have learnt 80% HTML as a beginner, then you are good to go for web development."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1167.5,1169.5," Now, there are some things directly related to HTML."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1169.5,1172.5," For example, if I write a lot of HTML codes,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1172.5,1175.5, I am writing HTML code like this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1175.5,1179.5, I have used the emitter abbreviation.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1179.5,1182.5, Don't worry about how I have written the code.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1182.5,1184.5, I will write this is HTML.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1184.5,1187.5, And I can open this HTML file directly.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1187.5,1191.5," And as soon as I open this HTML file directly,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1191.5,1194.5," You see, this will open like this."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1194.5,1197.5, I can open it directly by double clicking here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1197.5,1198.5, And it opened like this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1198.5,1199.5," Now, look, this is written as HTML."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1199.5,1201.5, But this is not styled at all.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1201.5,1204.5, This HTML file is very basic.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1204.5,1206.5," Now, you can run videos directly from HTML."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1206.5,1209.5, I have an HTML file that I will show you.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1209.5,1210.5, You can run videos with it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1210.5,1214.5, I do the work that I will show you by changing this HTML file.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1214.5,1216.5," So, we can show videos in this."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1216.5,1218.5," So, there is a video tag in HTML."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1218.5,1222.5," If we enter the video, then the video you will upload in SRC will be played."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1222.5,1224.5," For example, if I put video1.mp4 here,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1224.5,1227.5," You see, the video1.mp4 is automatically shown by VS Code."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1227.5,1229.5, This is the advantage of using VS Code.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1229.5,1232.5," So, you see here, I will reload it."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1232.5,1234.5," So, this video is automatically shown here."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1234.5,1235.5, I can play it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1235.5,1238.5," To play it, I will have to write controls here."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1238.5,1239.5, And I will refresh it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1239.5,1241.5," So, I will have the controls to play it."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1241.5,1242.5, I can play it.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1242.5,1244.5, This is a lot of money.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1244.5,1246.5, People need it to sell.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1246.5,1248.5, How much money do you need?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1248.5,1251.5, I am asking for 130 crores.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1251.5,1253.5," Final, absolutely."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1253.5,1256.5," Now, if I put video2.mp4 here."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1256.5,1258.5, I have put video1 here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1258.5,1259.5, I have two more videos.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1259.5,1261.5, I have some other videos here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1261.5,1262.5, If I put it here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1262.5,1264.5," And after that, I will refer to them."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1264.5,1266.5," If I put video2.mp4 here,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1266.5,1268.5, Then you will see video2.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1268.5,1269.5, I will reload it and show you.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1269.5,1271.5," If you put video2.mp4 here,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1271.5,1273.5, Then you can see video2.mp4 here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1273.5,1275.5," And after that, I will refer to them."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1275.5,1277.5, What is this?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1277.5,1279.5, This was the look-alike of Ben Stokes.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1279.5,1281.5," Now, if I do video3 here."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1281.5,1283.5, Suppose I do video3 here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1283.5,1285.5, Then my third video will be there.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1285.5,1287.5," So, I will reload it."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1287.5,1289.5," And you see, I can play it."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1289.5,1291.5, This is the third video.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1291.5,1292.5, I have gone.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1292.5,1294.5, I have played video3.mp4 here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1294.5,1296.5," So, I will close it."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1296.5,1298.5, And we can play video4 too.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1299.5,1301.5, And I have a video4.mp4 here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1301.5,1303.5, Where the DJ is playing.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1303.5,1305.5," So, you see this."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1314.5,1316.5," So, you can make such things."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1316.5,1317.5, You can use only HTML.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1317.5,1320.5," No, you don't have to do anything else."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1320.5,1322.5, You can play videos with only HTML.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1322.5,1323.5, You can play images.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1323.5,1325.5, You can play all this with only HTML.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1325.5,1327.5," Now, if you want to style it."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1327.5,1329.5," Suppose, I want a border to it."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1329.5,1331.5, Or a red background.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1331.5,1333.5," So, what I have to do for that?"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1333.5,1335.5, I have to use CSS for that.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1335.5,1338.5, CSS adds beauty to any website.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1338.5,1340.5, Then comes JavaScript.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1340.5,1343.5, Which adds interaction to the website.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1343.5,1346.5," For example, what will happen when I click on search."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1346.5,1348.5, What will happen when I write code with hr.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1348.5,1350.5," Like, code with hr is written."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1350.5,1352.5, And auto is completed here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1352.5,1353.5, Why did this come?
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1353.5,1354.5, This is why it came.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1354.5,1356.5, Because there was a request on the server.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1356.5,1358.5," And for this query,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1358.5,1360.5, the results of auto complete came here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1360.5,1362.5," So, all these things happen with JavaScript."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1362.5,1365.5, We call this client side scripting.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1365.5,1368.5," That is, if we want to do scripting in client here."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1368.5,1369.5, We want to do coding.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1369.5,1370.5, Only on client side.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1370.5,1373.5," So, we can do that with the help of JavaScript."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1373.5,1374.5, This is also a brain.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1374.5,1377.5," So, our website becomes beauty with brain."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1377.5,1378.5, I am talking about the website.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1378.5,1379.5, Beauty with brain.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1379.5,1381.5, CSS adds beauty.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1381.5,1384.5, And brain came from JavaScript.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1384.5,1387.5," Now, JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1387.5,1390.5," Like, if you have to change the content without loading the page."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1390.5,1392.5, Then all this is done with JavaScript.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1392.5,1394.5, There are a lot of mosquitoes here.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1394.5,1395.5," So, I will kill these mosquitoes here."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1395.5,1398.5," Oh, the mosquitoes are not getting anything from here."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1398.5,1400.5, My racket is working.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1400.5,1401.5, Oh my God!
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1401.5,1404.5, Like the video because I will eat the current chat for you.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1404.5,1405.5," So, when I was in college."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1405.5,1409.5," I was shocked that I have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1409.5,1411.5," First, learn HTML, CSS, and C."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1411.5,1413.5, Until I remember all the properties.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1413.5,1414.5," Then, learn JavaScript."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1414.5,1416.5, But this is wrong.

1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1598.5,1602.5, I want to give you a good analogy to teach HTML CSS and JavaScript.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1602.5,1604.5, HTML is like car skeleton.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1604.5,1608.5," If you paint CSS in it and it is in internal engine car,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1608.5,1610.5, then it is JavaScript.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1610.5,1614.5," For example, a skeleton is HTML."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1614.5,1617.5," If you have skin, then CSS."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1617.5,1621.5, And brain is like a nervous system.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1621.5,1624.5, Now I will take you to phobes.com.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1624.5,1628.5," If you go to phobes, then a website is opened here."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1628.5,1633.5, And phobes.com is a website that uses HTML CSS and JavaScript.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1633.5,1635.5, Like a different website.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1635.5,1640.5," If I click on right click, then the inspect element is opened."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1640.5,1644.5," Now look here, they have used script in the head."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1644.5,1648.5, And here they have used link to add CSS.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1648.5,1652.5," So what I will do here is, I will remove the CSS from here."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1652.5,1654.5," So what I will do to remove CSS,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1654.5,1659.5, I will clear all the style tags and all of them using delete key.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1659.5,1664.5," So as soon as I remove all the style tags and all the link tags,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1664.5,1668.5," As soon as I have read all their style sheets, look at the state of this page."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1668.5,1670.5, This page is showing something like this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1670.5,1672.5, It is just raw HTML.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1672.5,1674.5," What size should be of images, how should images be of images,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1674.5,1676.5, I have forgotten all this.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1676.5,1679.5," And only raw HTML is written here, which is not styled at all."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1679.5,1682.5, So phobes.com is looking like this without CSS.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1682.5,1685.5," Without CSS, it is showing only raw buttons,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1685.5,1689.5," raw text, raw links."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1689.5,1692.5," And similarly, I can remove the script accent here"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1692.5,1694.5, to see without JavaScript's website.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1694.5,1697.5," Now if I delete the HTML tag of this page,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1697.5,1700.5," like this, I have deleted the head from it,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1700.5,1702.5," I have deleted all of them, so it has become a blank page."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1702.5,1704.5," That is, without HTML, this is not even a status."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1704.5,1708.5," So this is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a web page."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1708.5,1711.5," I would like to tell you that this course was initially made to be paid,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1711.5,1714.5, but I changed my mode and converted it to free course.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1714.5,1718.5," And I thought I would put it on YouTube, so I want you all to be serious."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1718.5,1721.5, Many people have reached out to me to launch this course paid course.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1721.5,1723.5, There are many big companies there.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1723.5,1725.5," But I was getting a voice from the heart, this course should be free."
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1725.5,1727.5," Because when I learnt web development, I can understand that"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1727.5,1730.5," when you don't have a course to learn well,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1730.5,1733.5," and you don't have the affordability to buy a paid course,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1733.5,1737.5, then I can understand and I decided that there was a Sigma web development course.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1737.5,1739.5, It should be launched absolutely free.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1739.5,1741.5," This course is free, but it is free of charge."

1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1753.5,1755.5, then just send me a green leaf or red leaf.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1755.5,1758.5," But you have to be careful when you start earning well,"
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1758.5,1760.5, only after you start earning good.
1,Installing VS Code & How Websites Work,1760.5,1762.5," So, while keeping the joke aside, in the next video, I will tell you"

2,Your First HTML Website,121.4,123.4, And here I will add
2,Your First HTML Website,123.4,125.4, a new repository.
2,Your First HTML Website,125.4,127.4, I will click on add.
2,Your First HTML Website,127.4,129.4, I will click on create new repository.
2,Your First HTML Website,129.4,131.4, I will name it.
2,Your First HTML Website,131.4,133.4, I will name it Sigma Web Dev Course.
2,Your First HTML Website,133.4,135.4, And this is our folder.
2,Your First HTML Website,135.4,137.4, So I will select this folder.
2,Your First HTML Website,137.4,139.4, Initialize this repository with
2,Your First HTML Website,139.4,141.4, GridMe. And here I will write
2,Your First HTML Website,141.4,143.4, source code for Sigma Web Development Course.
2,Your First HTML Website,143.4,145.4, I will click on create repository.
2,Your First HTML Website,145.4,147.4, This will make our repository
2,Your First HTML Website,147.4,149.4, which is called Sigma Web Dev Course.
2,Your First HTML Website,149.4,151.4, The first relevant things from the first video
2,Your First HTML Website,151.4,153.4, I will put them here.
2,Your First HTML Website,153.4,155.4, These were the files. The first relevant
2,Your First HTML Website,155.4,157.4, from the first video. So I will name it
2,Your First HTML Website,157.4,159.4, Video1. Right Click New Folder.
2,Your First HTML Website,159.4,161.4, I will name it Video1.
2,Your First HTML Website,161.4,163.4, And I will move these files in Video1 folder.
2,Your First HTML Website,163.4,165.4, I am not pushing this video on all the
2,Your First HTML Website,165.4,167.4, Git. You can use your sample videos.
2,Your First HTML Website,167.4,169.4, So now I will update
2,Your First HTML Website,169.4,171.4, the source code here.
2,Your First HTML Website,171.4,173.4, And I will push it on the Git.
2,Your First HTML Website,173.4,175.4, How to push it on the Git.
2,Your First HTML Website,175.4,177.4, You guys don't need to learn this.
2,Your First HTML Website,177.4,179.4, But this procedure is very simple.
2,Your First HTML Website,179.4,181.4, I will tell you why I use Git.
2,Your First HTML Website,181.4,183.4, I will tell you why I use Git.
2,Your First HTML Website,183.4,185.4, We use the general coders.
2,Your First HTML Website,185.4,187.4, When they have to
2,Your First HTML Website,187.4,189.4, collaborate with other people.
2,Your First HTML Website,189.4,191.4, So what will happen is that you
2,Your First HTML Website,191.4,193.4, will work with many programmers.
2,Your First HTML Website,193.4,195.4, And those programmers will collaborate
2,Your First HTML Website,195.4,197.4, with your source code.
2,Your First HTML Website,197.4,199.4, And to do this kind of collaboration
2,Your First HTML Website,199.4,201.4, they will also push some code.
2,Your First HTML Website,201.4,203.4, You will also push some code.
2,Your First HTML Website,203.4,205.4, Maybe a person is editing a file.
2,Your First HTML Website,205.4,207.4, If a person is editing another file.
2,Your First HTML Website,207.4,209.4, So here the GitHub is used.
2,Your First HTML Website,209.4,211.4, And what is GitHub Desktop?
2,Your First HTML Website,211.4,213.4, GitHub Desktop is a utility to use Git.
2,Your First HTML Website,213.4,215.4," In Git and GitHub, the difference is that"
2,Your First HTML Website,215.4,217.4, GitHub is a Microsoft owned company.
2,Your First HTML Website,217.4,219.4, Which is used to use Git.
2,Your First HTML Website,219.4,221.4, Repositories help you to
2,Your First HTML Website,221.4,223.4, host on your web interface.
2,Your First HTML Website,223.4,225.4, In the upcoming videos about Git
2,Your First HTML Website,225.4,227.4, I will tell you more.
2,Your First HTML Website,227.4,229.4, But I am pushing this repository on
2,Your First HTML Website,229.4,231.4, the code with the GitHub account.
2,Your First HTML Website,231.4,233.4, The link in the description
2,Your First HTML Website,233.4,235.4, will be given to the repository.
2,Your First HTML Website,235.4,237.4, So as soon as I give you the links.
2,Your First HTML Website,237.4,239.4, You will get the code if you follow it.
2,Your First HTML Website,239.4,241.4, And I will talk about it.
2,Your First HTML Website,241.4,243.4, I am making this video course
2,Your First HTML Website,243.4,245.4, so I will click on the Publisher repository.
2,Your First HTML Website,245.4,247.4, The code will sink
2,Your First HTML Website,247.4,249.4, from the GitHub account.
2,Your First HTML Website,249.4,251.4, So the code that I am going to upload
2,Your First HTML Website,251.4,253.4, will go to the GitHub account
2,Your First HTML Website,253.4,255.4, and it will sink.
2,Your First HTML Website,255.4,257.4, The changes that will be there.
2,Your First HTML Website,257.4,259.4, If someone has changed it.
2,Your First HTML Website,259.4,261.4, I can pull it here.
2,Your First HTML Website,261.4,263.4, I will teach you all this.
2,Your First HTML Website,263.4,265.4, I will dedicate a video to Git.
2,Your First HTML Website,265.4,267.4, Don't worry. I did this
2,Your First HTML Website,267.4,269.4, so that I can give you the code.
2,Your First HTML Website,269.4,271.4, I will make a video 2 folder.
2,Your First HTML Website,271.4,273.4, I will go inside.
2,Your First HTML Website,273.4,275.4, I will click on Shift and open with VS Code.
2,Your First HTML Website,275.4,277.4, So here it is open with code.
2,Your First HTML Website,277.4,279.4, You will get this option.
2,Your First HTML Website,279.4,281.4, As I have told you.
2,Your First HTML Website,281.4,283.4, If you have changed it.
2,Your First HTML Website,283.4,285.4, And you have not checked it.
2,Your First HTML Website,285.4,287.4, You can have a problem.
2,Your First HTML Website,287.4,289.4, We will dismiss it.
2,Your First HTML Website,289.4,291.4, I will make the file here.
2,Your First HTML Website,291.4,293.4, I will make the index.
2,Your First HTML Website,293.4,295.4, That file will be made here.
2,Your First HTML Website,295.4,297.4, So you all know about it.
2,Your First HTML Website,297.4,299.4, I know a lot of intermediate people here.
2,Your First HTML Website,299.4,301.4, We already know all this.
2,Your First HTML Website,301.4,303.4, But I am making this code.
2,Your First HTML Website,303.4,305.4, So that all beginners can follow along.
2,Your First HTML Website,305.4,307.4, So I will make it here from 3 files.
2,Your First HTML Website,307.4,309.4, I made the index.html here.
2,Your First HTML Website,309.4,311.4, The second file I am going to make is style.css.
2,Your First HTML Website,311.4,313.4, And the third file I am going to make is script.js.
2,Your First HTML Website,313.4,315.4, And the name of these files can be anything.
2,Your First HTML Website,315.4,317.4, But I just want to keep these files self-explanatory.
2,Your First HTML Website,317.4,319.4, So that they can see the name and know what they are doing.
2,Your First HTML Website,319.4,321.4, Index.html file.
2,Your First HTML Website,321.4,323.4, Script.js.
2,Your First HTML Website,323.4,325.4, Java script file.
2,Your First HTML Website,325.4,327.4, Style.css.
2,Your First HTML Website,327.4,329.4, So I made these 3 files here.
2,Your First HTML Website,329.4,331.4, I will go to index.html and put the exclamation mark.
2,Your First HTML Website,331.4,333.4, And as soon as I put the exclamation mark.
2,Your First HTML Website,333.4,335.4, You see this code is here.
2,Your First HTML Website,335.4,337.4, I will click on view word wrap.
2,Your First HTML Website,337.4,339.4, So that you can see the code.
2,Your First HTML Website,339.4,341.4, The horizontal scroll bar is removed from the word wrap.
2,Your First HTML Website,341.4,343.4, I checked the word wrap.
2,Your First HTML Website,343.4,345.4, So here you all see.
2,Your First HTML Website,345.4,347.4, That we will understand this code.
2,Your First HTML Website,347.4,349.4, But for now you can understand that this code.
2,Your First HTML Website,349.4,351.4, This code.
2,Your First HTML Website,351.4,353.4, This code.
2,Your First HTML Website,353.4,355.4, We will use it to make a website.
2,Your First HTML Website,355.4,357.4, Now let's go to the extension tab of VS Code.
2,Your First HTML Website,357.4,359.4, Extensions.
2,Your First HTML Website,359.4,361.4, They are used to enhance the functionality of VS Code.

2,Your First HTML Website,637.4,639.4, Let's see how to do this.
2,Your First HTML Website,639.4,641.4, The biggest question of people.
2,Your First HTML Website,641.4,643.4, There are two ways to see.
2,Your First HTML Website,643.4,645.4, The one that we have installed live server.
2,Your First HTML Website,645.4,647.4, Live preview.
2,Your First HTML Website,647.4,649.4, The live server used to work.
2,Your First HTML Website,649.4,651.4, But Microsoft released live preview.
2,Your First HTML Website,651.4,653.4, So I will recommend the latest extension.
2,Your First HTML Website,653.4,655.4, This is also live server.
2,Your First HTML Website,655.4,657.4, But I am not going to run live server.
2,Your First HTML Website,657.4,659.4, I am going to use live preview.
2,Your First HTML Website,659.4,661.4, After installing live preview.
2,Your First HTML Website,661.4,663.4, You can see this icon.
2,Your First HTML Website,663.4,665.4, I will show you this website.
2,Your First HTML Website,665.4,667.4, Because my website will be in the browser.

2,Your First HTML Website,1403.4,1405.4, And you will get good money by making them.
2,Your First HTML Website,1405.4,1407.4, Many people integrate APIs.

2,Your First HTML Website,1409.4,1411.4, Many people earn good money.
2,Your First HTML Website,1411.4,1413.4, Many people say that chat GBT is here.
2,Your First HTML Website,1413.4,1415.4, So chat GBT is here.
2,Your First HTML Website,1415.4,1417.4, So nothing can happen.
2,Your First HTML Website,1417.4,1419.4, But this is not true.
2,Your First HTML Website,1419.4,1421.4, It is more easy.
2,Your First HTML Website,1421.4,1423.4, When you use chat GBT.
2,Your First HTML Website,1423.4,1425.4, You become a giga chat developer.
2,Your First HTML Website,1429.4,1431.4, So use more than chat GBT.
2,Your First HTML Website,1431.4,1433.4, And you can save your time.
2,Your First HTML Website,1433.4,1435.4," In fact, I tell you the truth."

2,Your First HTML Website,1439.4,1441.4, I had to make as many websites as possible.
2,Your First HTML Website,1441.4,1443.4, I do more than half of the work.
2,Your First HTML Website,1443.4,1445.4, And the work that can't do chat GBT.
2,Your First HTML Website,1445.4,1447.4, I do it. Finally I package it.
2,Your First HTML Website,1447.4,1449.4, And I don't have to answer anyone.
2,Your First HTML Website,1449.4,1451.4, What I used chat GBT.
2,Your First HTML Website,1451.4,1453.4, What I did without chat GBT.
2,Your First HTML Website,1453.4,1455.4, You can deliver everything easily.
2,Your First HTML Website,1455.4,1457.4, Use chat GBT.
2,Your First HTML Website,1457.4,1459.4, You can't do everything.
2,Your First HTML Website,1459.4,1461.4, You have to use chat GBT.
2,Your First HTML Website,1461.4,1463.4, And after that you have to make websites.
2,Your First HTML Website,1463.4,1465.4, You have to deliver freelance clients.
2,Your First HTML Website,1465.4,1467.4, From where you can meet freelancing clients.
2,Your First HTML Website,1467.4,1469.4, You can go to a website like Fiverr.
2,Your First HTML Website,1469.4,1471.4, I know it is difficult to get work on Fiverr.
2,Your First HTML Website,1471.4,1473.4, But you can go to the buyer request.
2,Your First HTML Website,1473.4,1475.4, There is a buyer request option in Fiverr.
2,Your First HTML Website,1475.4,1477.4, You can match it with buyer.
2,Your First HTML Website,1477.4,1479.4, If I show you images.
2,Your First HTML Website,1479.4,1481.4, You can give your pitch to the buyer request.
2,Your First HTML Website,1481.4,1483.4, I have done this.
2,Your First HTML Website,1483.4,1485.4, And to do this.
2,Your First HTML Website,1485.4,1487.4, You will get work.
2,Your First HTML Website,1487.4,1489.4, You will get good reviews on your gig.
2,Your First HTML Website,1489.4,1491.4, You will earn more money.
2,Your First HTML Website,1491.4,1493.4," For example, Fiverr's gig."
2,Your First HTML Website,1493.4,1495.4, No one has ordered it.
2,Your First HTML Website,1495.4,1497.4, You will never get easy work.
2,Your First HTML Website,1497.4,1499.4, But if you have ordered on one gig.
2,Your First HTML Website,1499.4,1501.4, 5-6 people have ordered.
2,Your First HTML Website,1501.4,1503.4, And everyone has given you 5 stars.
2,Your First HTML Website,1503.4,1505.4, Then things get easier for you.
2,Your First HTML Website,1505.4,1507.4, Because buyers want
2,Your First HTML Website,1507.4,1509.4, to get the work done.
2,Your First HTML Website,1509.4,1511.4, So that they get the work done.
2,Your First HTML Website,1511.4,1513.4, And they are also giving money.
2,Your First HTML Website,1513.4,1515.4, They want to give money.
2,Your First HTML Website,1515.4,1517.4, So they don't have to waste money.
2,Your First HTML Website,1517.4,1519.4, So here Fiverr Upwork.
2,Your First HTML Website,1519.4,1521.4, And there are many freelancing websites.
2,Your First HTML Website,1521.4,1523.4, But before trying.
2,Your First HTML Website,1523.4,1525.4, You have to make good websites.
2,Your First HTML Website,1525.4,1527.4, And today's day is responsive.
2,Your First HTML Website,1527.4,1529.4, You have to integrate chat GBT API.
2,Your First HTML Website,1529.4,1531.4, You will get such work.
2,Your First HTML Website,1531.4,1533.4, You will not say that you should make a design.
2,Your First HTML Website,1533.4,1535.4, Make it simple.
2,Your First HTML Website,1535.4,1537.4, I am saying that most of the clients
2,Your First HTML Website,1537.4,1539.4, don't do this.
2,Your First HTML Website,1539.4,1541.4, You can make complex websites.
2,Your First HTML Website,1541.4,1543.4, And earn more money.
2,Your First HTML Website,1543.4,1545.4, Then another thing.
2,Your First HTML Website,1545.4,1547.4, Get a job as a web developer.
2,Your First HTML Website,1547.4,1549.4, If you get a job as a web developer.
2,Your First HTML Website,1549.4,1551.4, You will get a job.
2,Your First HTML Website,1551.4,1553.4, And not like this.
2,Your First HTML Website,1553.4,1555.4, Senior developers demand is increasing.
2,Your First HTML Website,1555.4,1557.4, And their package is also increasing.
2,Your First HTML Website,1557.4,1559.4, People are earning more money in coding.
2,Your First HTML Website,1559.4,1561.4, If you are a basic developer.
2,Your First HTML Website,1561.4,1563.4, You will get some job.
2,Your First HTML Website,1563.4,1565.4, After this you can sell your services.

2,Your First HTML Website,1579.4,1581.4, Who say that they want to make a website.
2,Your First HTML Website,1581.4,1583.4, I am not saying that you should have a lot of followers.
2,Your First HTML Website,1583.4,1585.4, You can start with a very less following.
2,Your First HTML Website,1585.4,1587.4, After this you can give help to people.
2,Your First HTML Website,1587.4,1589.4, You can give help to people.
2,Your First HTML Website,1589.4,1591.4, You can get this from your clients Instagram.
2,Your First HTML Website,1591.4,1593.4, Or social media.

3,Basic Structure of an HTML Website,249.14000000000001,252.74, This additionally used the functionalities of CSS and JavaScript
3,Basic Structure of an HTML Website,252.74,255.54000000000002, to link this HTML page.

4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",20.16,22.06, And you will be able to use it in actual use.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",22.06,23.42, So let's start quickly.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",23.42,25.240000000000002," Write down in the comments below,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",25.240000000000002,27.8," Sigma batch OP, let's roll the intro."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",30.0,40.4," So guys, as you can see, it has already matched in the computer screen."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",40.4,43.76," And if you haven't accessed the playlist yet, then you can access it."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",43.76,52.760000000000005," One more thing I want to tell you is that if you go to github.com, you will get the github repo of Sigma Web Dev course."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",52.760000000000005,57.56," I have made all the videos in this, and the committee has also made it according to the folder."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",57.56,58.56, So you will get it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",58.56,61.92, So you have to access it so that you get the source code.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",61.92,64.32000000000001, I will also put the video in the description.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",64.32000000000001,66.02000000000001, So there is no problem.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",66.02000000000001,69.32000000000001, Now we will make a very basic website today.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",69.32000000000001,73.32000000000001, But it will be very important for us because it will be our first useful website.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",73.32000000000001,74.82000000000001, So I will not take much time.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",74.82000000000001,78.92, I will make a new folder in this Sigma Web Dev folder.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",78.92,81.92, And I will name it video4 because it is our fourth video.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",81.92,83.92, So I will make it by name of video4.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",83.92,88.92, I will click Shift right and open with code so that this folder opens in our VS code.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",88.92,91.92," After doing this, I will do the same thing that we always do."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",91.92,97.92," Index.html, main.css, style.css and script.js."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",97.92,99.92, We usually make these three files.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",99.92,101.92," If I write CSS, I will write here."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",101.92,102.92," If I write script, I will write here."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",102.92,107.92," But for now, I will write an exclamation mark here and write in a document like this."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",107.92,109.92, My bookmarks.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",109.92,111.92," Okay, so we are going to make a bookmark website."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",111.92,113.92, I will write code here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",113.92,115.92, So you must have seen these titles.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",115.92,117.92, Now I will write H1 here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",117.92,119.92, What happens with H1?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",119.92,121.92, You can use H1 to add heading to your web page.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",121.92,123.92, We talked about basic structure.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",123.92,125.92, We said that this is HTML page.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",125.92,127.92, HTML lang is equal to en.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",127.92,129.92000000000002, Lang is an attribute and its value is en.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",129.92000000000002,131.92000000000002," That is, this page's content is in English."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",131.92000000000002,133.92000000000002, This tells this search engine.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",133.92000000000002,135.92000000000002," Or if anyone is taking this web page link,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",135.92000000000002,137.92000000000002, then he will know that this web page is in English.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",137.92000000000002,139.92000000000002, He can parse this web page.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",139.92,143.92, The browser will also know that your web page is in English.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",143.92,147.92," Now here is the head in which the metadata, title, page,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",147.92,149.92, the CSS link is there.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",149.92,151.92, All these things are information.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",151.92,153.92, The main content is in the body.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",153.92,155.92, Now there is a tag to add heading to the body.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",155.92,157.92, Its name is H1.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",157.92,159.92, And I am going to write my bookmarks in it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",159.92,161.92," So if I write my bookmarks here,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",161.92,163.92, then we will write this H1 tag.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",163.92,165.92," And if I want to do it live,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",165.92,167.92, I will click here and then I will open it in the browser.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",167.92,169.92," So look at this, it shows my bookmarks like this."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",169.92,171.92, Now why should we always use H1?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",171.92,173.92, Why didn't I write my bookmarks directly?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",173.92,175.92, Because I am telling the browser that
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",175.92,177.92, this is my heading and this is my first level heading.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",177.92,179.92," Now believe me, I want to keep two types of bookmarks"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",179.92,181.92, in my bookmarks.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",181.92,183.92, One is the main bookmarks and one is the secondary bookmarks.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",183.92,185.92," So I will use H2, that is, the heading of the second level."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",185.92,187.92, So I will write here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",187.92,189.92," If you have used Microsoft Word,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",189.92,191.92, you will know what H1 and H2 are.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",191.92,193.92," But if you don't know, I will tell you that H1 is your main level heading."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",193.92,195.92, And the heading of the second level
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",195.92,197.92, is from H2.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",197.92,199.92, I will say that the main bookmarks
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",199.92,201.92, and secondary bookmarks.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",201.92,203.92, I will do something like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",203.92,205.92, And here I will press
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",205.92,207.92," Alt, Shift, Alt, Down Arrow."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",207.92,209.92, I will do the work.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",209.92,211.92, Why don't I turn on the screencast mode?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",211.92,213.92," So what I did here, Alt, Shift, Alt, Down Arrow."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",213.92,215.92, So this is the replicate.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",215.92,217.92, This is the shortcut for VS Code.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",217.92,219.92, I would like to tell you another shortcut for VS Code.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",219.92,221.92, If you press Alt in your keyboard and after that
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",221.92,223.92," wherever you click, it will become cursor."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",223.92,225.92," If I click here, it will become only one cursor."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",225.92,227.92," But by pressing Alt,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",227.92,229.92," if I click somewhere else, it will become a cursor."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",229.92,231.92," As you know, all the bookmarks"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",231.92,233.92, want to do the bookmarks code with Hari.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",233.92,235.92, So my bookmarks dash code with Hari.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",235.92,237.92, I can write something like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",237.92,239.92, How did I do this? I clicked here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",239.92,241.92," Then I pressed Alt. And wherever I press Alt,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",241.92,243.92, I will click there. I will get multiple cursor.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",243.92,245.92," Then whatever I type,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",245.92,247.92, they will come in multiple cursor.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",247.92,249.92," Wherever there are cursor, whatever I type,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",249.92,251.92, it will be visible. It will be fun.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",251.92,253.92, Like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",253.92,255.92, So I will remove it like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",255.92,257.91999999999996, And you will see that it will be updated.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",257.91999999999996,259.91999999999996, So this is my main heading. This is my H2.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",259.91999999999996,261.91999999999996," Similarly, we have H6 with H1, H2."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",261.91999999999996,263.91999999999996, Suppose you gave the main heading.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",263.91999999999996,265.91999999999996," After the main heading, you gave a secondary heading."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",265.91999999999996,267.91999999999996," After that, you had to give some heading."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",267.91999999999996,269.91999999999996, And so on.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",269.91999999999996,271.91999999999996, You had to give a lot of subheadings.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",271.91999999999996,273.91999999999996, Then you can give H6 heading.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",273.91999999999996,275.91999999999996, H6 is more than enough.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",275.91999999999996,277.91999999999996, Html has given 6 headings.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",277.91999999999996,279.91999999999996, You will never need H7.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",279.92,281.92, If you talk about it in practical life.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",281.92,283.92," And if you read it, you can use H6 repeatedly."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",283.92,285.92, Because it gets so small after H1.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",285.92,287.92, That H6 will become very small.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",287.92,289.92, So it will not be so small.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",289.92,291.92, Now what I will do here?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",291.92,293.92, Alt Shift Down Error.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",293.92,295.92, I will replicate it. And I will click here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",295.92,297.92, I will press Alt. I am telling you all these shortcuts.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",297.92,299.92, So that your productivity is increased.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",299.92,301.92, Now I have put two cursor here and here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",301.92,303.92, I will press backspace and H3.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",303.92,305.92, Then I will click here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",305.92,307.92, I will press Alt. I will click here. I will H4 it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",307.92,309.92, And I will click here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",309.92,311.92, I will click here. I will click H5.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",311.92,313.92, After that I will click here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",313.92,315.92, I will click here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",315.92,317.92, I will click H6 here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",317.92,319.92, Now what I will do? I will write here using H1.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",319.92,321.92, So that you know.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",321.92,323.92, I will write here using.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",323.92,325.92, I will press space. I will write using. I will write H.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",325.92,327.92, And here I have left my work.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",327.92,329.92," Click here and have two, three, four, five and six."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",329.92,331.92, And you see it looks like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",331.92,333.92, So you know that H1 is like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",333.92,335.92, H2 is like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",335.92,337.92, H4 is like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",337.92,339.92, H5 is like this. H6 is like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",339.92,341.92, And H6 is like this. Then what will happen?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",341.92,343.92, It will be over in a while.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",343.92,345.92, So H6 is more than enough.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",345.92,347.92, So I will show you a practical demonstration.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",347.92,349.92," For example, this is my HTML tutorial."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",349.92,351.92, So here I have given the main heading.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",351.92,353.92, After this I have given the word as HTML.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",353.92,355.92, Then I have given the features of HTML.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",355.92,357.92, I have given this from H1.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",357.92,359.92, I have given this from H2.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",359.92,361.92, After that I have given something in H2.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",361.92,363.92, So I have given something in H3.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",363.92,365.92, This is the text and markup language.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",365.92,367.92, This is heading 2.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",367.92,369.92, What is the main heading of the page?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",369.92,371.92, This is the introduction of HTML.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",371.92,373.92," After this, this is the sub-heading."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",373.92,375.92, I had to give some exercise in this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",375.92,377.92, So I used H3 in it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",377.92,379.92, Then H2 came back.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",379.92,381.92, Because it was inside.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",381.92,383.92," So H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 are used to build the hierarchy."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",383.92,385.92, Okay. I hope you understood.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",385.92,387.92, Many people are commenting.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",387.92,389.92, You are starting very slowly.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",389.92,391.92, So we know.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",391.92,393.92," If I tell you something, you will say yes."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",393.92,395.92, It is very easy.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",395.92,397.92," If I tell you something, you will say yes."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",397.92,399.92, Then I will say JavaScript.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",399.92,401.92, Then I will say bootstrap.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",401.92,403.92, Then you will say yes.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",403.92,405.92, It will be done.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",405.92,407.92, Then I will say react.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",407.92,409.92, Then I will say note.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",409.92,411.92, Then I will take the things.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",411.92,413.92, Then I will take the things.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",413.92,415.92," Then after that, I will go up the level."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",415.92,417.92, I had told you that we will raise the bar.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",417.92,419.92, This is what I meant.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",419.92,421.92, We will do the react when I will make projects there.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",421.92,423.92, When I will do dangerous things.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",423.92,425.92, Then I will ask them for their comments.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",425.92,427.92, Tell me what is the level?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",427.92,429.92, Don't talk about the level.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",429.92,431.92, The level is going to rise.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",431.92,433.92, So these are our headings.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",433.92,435.92, 6 headings that I want to keep like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",435.92,437.92," Now if we want to write a paragraph,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",437.92,439.92, You can use P tag.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",439.92,441.92, P will enter.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",441.92,443.92, Now I will tell you a shortcut trick.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",443.92,445.92," If you want to play dummy paragraph in the M8 through VS code,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",445.92,447.92, What will you do?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",447.92,449.92, You will write LORAM23.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",449.92,451.92, Here M at abbreviation is here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",451.92,453.92, This is LORAM23.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",453.92,455.92, You can write a word here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",455.92,457.92, You can't get horizontal stroll bar.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",457.92,459.92, So you can write this word.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",459.92,461.92, Now here you see LORAM.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",461.92,463.92, $ $ $ $
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",463.92,465.92, Here is a dummy text.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",465.92,467.92, Why do we want dummy text sometimes?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",467.92,469.92, Because we are making a template.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",469.92,471.92, We don't want to fill that template.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",471.92,473.92, Suppose you are making a website.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",473.92,475.92, Which looks like OYO rooms.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",475.92,477.92, Now here OYO become a member.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",477.92,479.92, OYO for business.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",479.92,481.92, I don't want to write all this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",481.92,483.92, I just wrote LORAM.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",483.92,485.92, Now I want to write something here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",485.92,487.92, So I will write 7 words here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",487.92,489.92, I will enter LORAM 7.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",489.92,491.92, Then I will give it to the OYO people.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",491.92,493.92, You use this to fill the place holder.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",493.92,495.92, My plan is that we will make
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",495.92,497.92, the clones of popular websites.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",497.92,499.92, So that you will know how things work.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",499.92,501.92, This is also a popular website.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",501.92,503.92," If you have used their services,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",503.92,505.92, you can tell me in the comments.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",505.92,507.92, Now we will see other things.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",507.92,509.92, Here is the paragraph.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",509.92,511.92, How to style it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",511.92,513.9200000000001, All these things are done through CSS.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",513.9200000000001,515.9200000000001," Now in the paragraph,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",515.9200000000001,517.9200000000001," when I wrote LORAM 23,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",517.9200000000001,519.9200000000001, I will enter P enter.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",519.9200000000001,521.9200000000001, Suppose I write LORAM 10.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",521.9200000000001,523.9200000000001, Then only 10 words will come.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",523.9200000000001,525.9200000000001, And if I want to write LORAM 100.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",525.9200000000001,527.9200000000001," If my page will be filled too much,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",527.9200000000001,529.9200000000001, then I can do that too.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",529.9200000000001,531.9200000000001, So this LORAM value trick is very good.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",531.92,533.92," Whenever we make a clone of popular websites,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",533.92,535.92, suppose I make a clone of Amazon.in.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",535.92,537.92," If I make a clone of Amazon.in,"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",537.92,539.92, suppose I have to write something here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",539.92,541.92, I can't see much text here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",541.92,543.92, Suppose I have to write 3 words here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",543.92,545.92, So I will write LORAM 3.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",545.92,547.92, I will not think about makeup products.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",547.92,549.92, I will write LORAM 4 or LORAM 3.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",549.92,551.92, And I will write LORAM 2.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",551.92,553.92, And I will make a template and then
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",553.92,555.92," whatever is there, it will come in my database."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",555.92,557.92, And I can bring it in my text.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",557.92,559.92, Many people asked me if this course
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",559.92,561.92, is going to be ready.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",561.92,563.92," Absolutely, I will make you"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",563.92,565.92, to be able to do the actual
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",565.92,567.92, industry level jobs through this course.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",567.92,569.92, Now let's talk about attributes in HTML.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",569.92,571.92, What are these attributes in HTML?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",571.92,573.92, Like I used HTML tag.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",573.92,575.92," Lang is equal to en, Lang is an attribute."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",575.92,577.92, We didn't use any attribute in the body.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",577.92,579.92, We didn't use any attribute in H1.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",579.92,581.92, We didn't use any attribute in P.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",581.92,583.92, But I can use a style attribute in P.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",583.92,585.92, Which is called inline CSS.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",585.92,587.92, I will red the background color on it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",587.92,589.92, If I red the background color
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",589.92,591.92, in some way.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",591.92,593.92, The color of the background color will be red.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",593.92,595.92, It is called inline CSS through style attribute.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",595.92,597.92, If you add CSS to style
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",597.92,599.92, we had learned to add CSS here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",599.92,601.92, But if you add style is equal to
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",601.92,603.92, you will get this background red.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",603.92,605.92, I will show you.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",605.92,607.92, I will use this color.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",607.92,609.92, This color is looking good.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",609.92,611.92, I can also add style inline.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",611.92,613.92, But when you make
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",613.92,615.92, the inline style in industry level
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",615.92,617.92, we use less styles.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",617.92,619.92, Because the sustainability is less.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",619.92,621.92, The reusability is less.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",621.92,623.92, We want to ship small bundles on the browser.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",623.92,625.92, And our website is more
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",625.92,627.92, optimized.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",627.92,629.92, But inline CSS has a style tag.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",629.92,631.92, But here style is an attribute.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",631.92,633.92, P is a tag.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",633.92,635.92, It is a style attribute of P tag.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",635.92,637.92, Through which we can style this element.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",637.92,639.92, We will learn more about attributes.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",639.92,641.92, Attributes basically give an element
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",641.92,643.92, enhanced functionality.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",643.92,645.92, We gave this paragraph
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",645.92,647.92, a style.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",647.92,649.92, This is the background color.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",649.92,651.92, To give this background color
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",651.92,653.92, we used style attribute.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",653.92,655.92, Similarly to give properties
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",655.92,657.92, we use
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",657.92,659.92, attributes like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",659.92,661.92," For example, if we talk about"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",661.92,663.92," link, link colon CSS"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",663.92,665.92, link has relic attribute
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",665.92,667.92, hrefc attribute.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",667.92,669.92, What can we do with this attribute?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",669.92,671.92, We can add this CSS style sheet.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",671.92,673.92," For example, background"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",673.92,675.92, background color
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",675.92,677.92, I say body first.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",677.92,679.92, What we want in body?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",679.92,681.92, Don't worry about this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",681.92,683.92, Don't worry about it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",683.92,685.92, Because CSS will tell you all about it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",685.92,687.92, But I am telling you that I am doing
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",687.92,689.92, hotpink.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",689.92,691.92, Listen to another functionality of VS code.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",691.92,693.92, This ninja technique is very useful.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",693.92,695.92, Over here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",695.92,697.92, And here you can choose the color you want.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",697.92,699.92, I will leave it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",699.92,701.92," So, here you can see the background color"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",701.92,703.92, of my body.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",703.92,705.92, How did you like the ninja technique?
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",705.92,707.92, Write in the comment.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",707.92,709.92, Now we are back in index.html.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",709.92,711.92, I can remove it if I want.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",711.92,713.92, I will comment on it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",713.92,715.92, This style sheet is not left.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",715.92,717.92, Which is very natural. The background color
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",717.92,719.92, was coming from this style sheet.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",719.92,721.92, This background color was coming from inline CSS.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",721.92,723.92," So, this is very natural."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",723.92,725.92, Here I have made this style
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",725.92,727.92, is equal to background color.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",727.92,729.92, Now we are going to make
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",729.92,731.92, bookmark manager.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",731.92,733.92, BookmarkManager.html
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",733.92,735.92, I am making it for a different file.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",735.92,737.92, Because I have told you all about
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",737.92,739.92, different headings.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",739.92,741.92, I am going to make a useful bookmark manager.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",741.92,743.92, I will write here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",743.92,745.92, BookmarkManager
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",745.92,747.92, Now you all know
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",747.92,749.92, why you are making this bookmark manager.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",749.92,751.92, This is made by our hands.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",751.92,753.92, This will be our child.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",753.92,755.92, We made this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",755.92,757.92, Because you made this yourself.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",757.92,759.92, One software you made
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",759.92,761.92, and one software you made
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",761.92,763.92, You made this yourself.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",763.92,765.92, You can see here
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",765.92,767.92, BookmarkManager.html
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",767.92,769.92, I will write here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",769.92,771.92, My Bookmarks.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",771.92,773.92, Now I will write here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",773.92,775.92, Primary Bookmarks.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",775.92,777.92, And then I will write here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",777.92,779.92, Secondary Bookmarks.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",779.92,781.92," In fact, if I do all shift"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",781.92,783.92, and I write here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",783.92,785.92, Secondary Bookmarks.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",785.92,787.92, I can write here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",787.92,789.92, Now I will write
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",789.92,791.92, Google in a paragraph.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",791.92,793.92, I will write it like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",793.92,795.92, We will write it from the list.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",795.92,797.92," But in the upcoming videos, I will tell you"
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",797.92,799.92, how to use the list.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",799.92,801.92," For now, you can understand it."
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",801.92,803.92, Google.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",803.92,805.92, Open Google.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",805.92,807.92, And I will use Anchor Tag.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",807.92,809.92, I will enter A as in A.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",809.92,811.92, It is a mandatory attribute.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",811.92,813.92, For which link to go.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",813.92,815.92, I will write HRAphys.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",815.92,817.92, Https.double slash www.google.com
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",817.92,819.92, It will go on this address.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",819.92,821.92, Whenever someone click on Open Google.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",821.92,823.92, I will cut this open Google.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",823.92,825.92, I will put it here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",825.92,827.92, Content of this stack will be like this.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",827.92,829.92, You can see here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",829.92,831.92, This is called Anchor Tag.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",831.92,833.92, Which helps us to make links.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",833.92,835.92, You must have seen many such links.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",835.92,837.92, Now you see here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",837.92,839.92, As soon as I
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",839.92,841.92, enter the image.html.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",841.92,843.92, You can see here.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",843.92,845.92, You can see all the bookmarks.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",845.92,847.92, Now I will click on it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",847.92,849.92, You can see.

4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",945.92,947.92, If you want it not to be in one line.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",947.92,949.92, What will you do now.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",949.92,951.92, You will put it in your own paragraph.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",951.92,953.92, This is a dirty way.

4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",985.92,987.92, This is not a good way to use paragraphs.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",987.92,989.92, We never make lists.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",989.92,991.92, We make lists.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",991.92,993.92, But because we have not made lists.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",993.92,995.92, We are using paragraphs.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",995.92,997.92, But this will do our job.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",997.92,999.92, This will look like this.

4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",1041.92,1043.92, Bookmark manager is your title.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",1043.92,1045.92, And I will write it in H1.

4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",1047.92,1049.92, This title will be same.

4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",1067.92,1069.92, If you double click it and open it.

4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",1071.92,1073.92, Open with it.
4,"Heading, Paragraphs and Links",1073.92,1075.92, Choose another app.

5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",82.0,85.0," Now, I will put the exclamation mark and bring the image abbreviation here."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",85.0,87.0," And here, I will do the view word wrap."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",87.0,88.0, You have to work very hard.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",88.0,92.0, You can see that your word wrap is closed.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",92.0,95.0," So, what will happen here is that the horizontal scroll bar will not come."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",95.0,96.0, What will I do here?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",96.0,98.0, I will write images here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",98.0,100.0," First of all, I will write images here."

5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",114.0,115.0, Why will we bring the same image?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",115.0,116.0, I will do the same images.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",116.0,121.0," And here, in the video number 5 folder, there is a CMS file in the Sigma Web Development course."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",121.0,122.0," In fact, I will do one thing."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",122.0,123.0, I will cancel it.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",123.0,124.0, I will take its snippet.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",124.0,126.0, Because this is a CMS extension.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",126.0,127.0, I will go to PNG.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",127.0,130.0," So, I have pressed Windows, Shift and S."

5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",160.0,162.0," Okay, saved it in image."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",162.0,164.0," Now, there is an IMG tag in HTML."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",164.0,167.0," The way you will put it, SRC and Alt are required attributes."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",167.0,170.0," In fact, you will not write Alt, but it is recommended."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",170.0,172.0, I will tell you what are these attributes.

5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",175.0,176.0, You can see this image here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",176.0,177.0," So, image.png."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",177.0,178.0, And I will put it in Alt.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",178.0,179.0, Train Image.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",179.0,180.0, Okay.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",180.0,183.0," Now, if I show it to you by previewing it in the browser."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",183.0,184.0," See, it looks like this."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",184.0,186.0, This is our page and this is the image of the train.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",186.0,188.0, What happened by doing this?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",188.0,190.0," Alt, what we wrote, where did it go?"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",190.0,192.0," You can say, I will tell you where it went."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",192.0,193.0, I put it in Alt.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",193.0,196.0," See, we did not show the thing in Alt."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",196.0,199.0," Suppose for some reason, the server cannot see any image."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",199.0,200.0," Okay, then what will happen?"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",200.0,201.0, Suppose I wrote image2 by mistake.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",201.0,203.0," Now, image.png is not here."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",203.0,205.0," So, what will be the error?"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",205.0,206.0, I will show you.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",206.0,208.0," So, here the Alt will be displayed."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",208.0,211.0, And this kind of error image will be displayed.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",211.0,215.0, Which will tell you that you have put the image correctly.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",215.0,216.0, You have done something wrong.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",216.0,219.0," Here, the server's URL is not there."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",219.0,221.0," Okay, these kind of things are shown."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",221.0,222.0," And there, Alt is shown."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",222.0,225.0," So, the user will know what is the purpose of this image."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",225.0,227.0," Okay, and if I come back here,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",227.0,230.0, you can put the Alt in the image like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",230.0,232.0," If I do not put it in Alt, then what will happen?"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",232.0,234.0," If I do not put it in Alt, then the Alt text will not come."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",234.0,235.0, Nothing will happen.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",235.0,237.0," So, you will not want that when your server has an error,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",237.0,238.0, then give this image as a user.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",238.0,240.0, You will want something like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",240.0,241.0, The scenario is like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",241.0,242.0, The user will see you like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",242.0,244.0, The train image is written like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",244.0,246.0," Okay, I hope you understood."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",246.0,247.0," So, the image is straightforward."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",247.0,249.0, There are two more attributes of this image.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",249.0,250.0, The two attributes are very important.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",250.0,251.0, One is the width.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",251.0,252.0, Which is width in pixels.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",252.0,254.0," If I do 23, width is equal to,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",254.0,255.0, then you can see.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",255.0,257.0," In fact, I will correct the image first."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",257.0,258.0, I wrote image 2 by mistake.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",258.0,259.0, Image.png is here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",259.0,260.0," So, you can see here."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",260.0,261.0, I have taken 23 pixels.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",261.0,262.0, Which is very small.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",262.0,264.0," So, I will do 230 pixels."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",264.0,266.0, You do not need to write Px in this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",266.0,267.0," When we write width in CSS,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",267.0,270.0, then we will see that we need to write Px.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",270.0,271.0," Here, we write only width is equal to"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",271.0,273.0, the number in double quotes.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",273.0,274.0, As you can see.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",274.0,275.0, Okay.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",275.0,276.0," So, if I bring this here,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",276.0,278.0, then you see that this is a small image.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",278.0,280.0," If I give it height,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",280.0,281.0," I mean, I give it height too."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",281.0,283.0," I said, if you keep the height of 230,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",283.0,285.0, then its aspect ratio will be reduced.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",285.0,286.0," So, it will become a little stretched."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",286.0,288.0, Because it has also made its width 230
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",288.0,289.0, and height 230.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",289.0,290.0, As you can see.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",290.0,292.0, If you want height 230
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",292.0,294.0," and width automatically adjusted,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",294.0,295.0, then you can use height attribute.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",295.0,297.0," Now, remove the width."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",297.0,298.0," So, the height of 230 will be fixed."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",298.0,301.0, And the width will be adjusted automatically.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",301.0,302.0," Now, look."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",302.0,303.0, The width has been adjusted automatically.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",303.0,305.0, And the height is taken.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",305.0,306.0," Now, what happens is that"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",306.0,308.0," through CSS,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",308.0,309.0, it can be adjusted to width and height.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",309.0,310.0," And in the CSS section,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",310.0,313.0, we will see that why this width and height should be set.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",313.0,316.0, We should always set one thing from width and height.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",316.0,318.0," Such that, when our page load is there,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",318.0,320.0, then the image of our page
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",320.0,322.0, should not be in the page at all.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",322.0,324.0, I will tell you in the coming videos.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",324.0,325.0," But, you can understand that"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",325.0,327.0, these width and height attributes
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",327.0,329.0, I have told many people that
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",329.0,330.0, they have heard that they have been deprecated.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",330.0,331.0, They should not use it.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",331.0,333.0, But I say that they should use it for SEO purpose.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",333.0,335.0, Why should they do it?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",335.0,337.0, I will tell you in the coming videos.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",337.0,339.0, Where I will tell you about Core Web Vitals and SEO.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",339.0,341.0," For now, you can understand that"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",341.0,343.0, width gives the image and height gives the image.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",343.0,344.0," If someone has put one of them,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",344.0,346.0, then the other one automatically sets.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",346.0,348.0, And these values are in pixels.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",348.0,350.0, And you don't have to write Px or pixel.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",350.0,352.0, You just have to write this number.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",352.0,353.0, And that's it.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",353.0,355.0," This is an attribute, height."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",355.0,357.0," And it is an SRC attribute, an alt attribute."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",357.0,359.0, You can also use the style attribute in this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",359.0,361.0," In fact, you can use the style attribute"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",361.0,363.0, with almost all the tags.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",363.0,364.0, So this was the image.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",364.0,366.0, Now we will talk about the tables in HTML.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",366.0,369.0," In HTML, the table tag is very useful."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",369.0,371.0, I will tell you what is the table tag.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",371.0,373.0, You get to see the table from the table tag.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",373.0,375.0, Now I will copy this table from here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",375.0,377.0," And when I will copy this table from here,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",377.0,379.0, then you will see that my page will look like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",379.0,381.0, So this table of HTML.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",381.0,383.0, Where is my preview page?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",383.0,384.0, Here it is.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",384.0,386.0," Look at the name, HarryHundred."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",386.0,388.0," Now if I put a lot of things here,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",388.0,390.0, I will put some things here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",390.0,392.0, I will put some things here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",392.0,393.0, I will put the name.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",393.0,395.0, And here I will put
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",395.0,396.0, the designation.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",396.0,398.0, I will put the designation of Harry.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",398.0,401.0, And I want to put more things here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",401.0,403.0, I will use the Alt Shift bottom arrow.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",403.0,405.0, I will use the Alt Shift bottom arrow.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",405.0,407.0, And here I want to write
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",407.0,410.0, that favorite language.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",410.0,412.0, And I want to write here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",412.0,414.0, JavaScript.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",414.0,416.0, And now you see that this table will be like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",416.0,418.0," Name, destination, favorite language."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",418.0,420.0, So what is this?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",420.0,422.0, How does it work?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",422.0,424.0, Here we used table tag.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",424.0,426.0, Table tag is TR tag.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",426.0,428.0, Which is Table Row.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",428.0,430.0, You will get to see what will come in this row.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",430.0,432.0, Now if you want to use it as Table Heading.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",432.0,434.0, You say that this is my Table Row.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",434.0,436.0, That is this row.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",436.0,438.0," Name, destination and your favorite language."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",438.0,440.0, What will come in this row?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",440.0,442.0, And what will come?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",442.0,444.0, Here you can see that it will be a heading.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",444.0,446.0, So I will use TH.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",446.0,448.0, And I will write Table Heading.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",448.0,450.0, And I will write only one time.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",450.0,452.0," So the first one that will be TR, I will write TH."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",452.0,454.0, Now we put the heading.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",454.0,456.0, Then we will put the data.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",456.0,458.0, So we will put the TD in Table Row.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",458.0,460.0, Which stands from Table Data.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",460.0,462.0, And here you will put rows in all the TRs.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",462.0,464.0," Anyway, what will happen?"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",464.0,466.0, Your rows will be added.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",466.0,468.0, So here I will write SAM.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",468.0,470.0, And this is also a programmer.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",470.0,472.0, And this is also a programmer.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",472.0,474.0, And this is also a programmer.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",474.0,476.0, We will see from CSS how it can be
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",476.0,478.0, given a border.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",478.0,480.0, It can be styled. But this is shown in default.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",480.0,482.0," And yes, I know this is next."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",482.0,484.0, But you just understand that
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",484.0,486.0, Table works like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",486.0,488.0," Now there are rows, spans and call span attributes."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",488.0,490.0, Now you see here that the
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",490.0,492.0, means of how many rows your TD will span.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",492.0,494.0," For example,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",494.0,496.0, Let us say I write
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",496.0,498.0, I want SAM and programmer.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",498.0,500.0, Earlier we were taking one Excel.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",500.0,502.0, SAM was taking one Excel programmer.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",502.0,504.0, So I will write in two cells.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",504.0,506.0, So I want to write that I don't want to write in program.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",506.0,508.0, I just want to write SAM.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",508.0,510.0, And I want to write here that call span is equal to 2.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",510.0,512.0, So call span is equal to 2 means
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",512.0,514.0, that SAM will take
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",514.0,516.0, place of two columns.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",516.0,518.0, What does it mean? It means that it will take place of two columns.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",518.0,520.0," That is, it will show you how SAM will look."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",520.0,522.0, I will show you.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",522.0,524.0, So it took place of all these columns.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",524.0,526.0, So the call span
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",526.0,528.0, means how many columns will be rounded.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",528.0,530.0," By default, one column will be rounded."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",530.0,532.0, And one cell will be rounded.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",532.0,534.0," To demonstrate this, I will explain it to you with Excel."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",534.0,536.0," In Excel, you can understand that this is a table of MRI, HTML."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",536.0,538.0, Sometimes I want to span two columns of one data.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",538.0,540.0, So here we use
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",540.0,542.0, Merge cell.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",542.0,544.0, And here I write SAM.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",544.0,546.0," In HTML, this is done."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",546.0,548.0, We use call span. Sometimes we want to
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",548.0,550.0, vertically merge.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",550.0,552.0, I want to merge these two cells.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",552.0,554.0, We use row span.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",554.0,556.0, And who will we use the row span with?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",556.0,558.0, We will use the row span with
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",558.0,560.0, TD.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",560.0,562.0, We will use call span with TD.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",562.0,564.0, We will use the row span.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",564.0,566.0, So we will use this way.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",566.0,568.0, I hope you understood this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",568.0,570.0, When we will make the projects of
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",570.0,572.0," HTML, you will understand it better."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",572.0,574.0, But I will show you the row span quickly.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",574.0,576.0, So if I write
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",576.0,578.0," row span is equal to 2, and then I write"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",578.0,580.0, another TR here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",580.0,582.0, You will see that this table is showing this way.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",582.0,584.0," To explain this better,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",584.0,586.0, I will put a CSS style here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",586.0,588.0, I will add a style sheet.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",588.0,590.0, And I will name this style sheet as
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",590.0,592.0, style.css.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",592.0,594.0, You don't need to understand CSS.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",594.0,596.0, I will tell you already.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",596.0,598.0, I will write in TD
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",598.0,600.0, 2px solid black.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",600.0,602.0, I will tell you how it works.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",602.0,604.0," But for now, you can understand that I have"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",604.0,606.0, put this. To explain you.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",606.0,608.0, I said that this row is
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",608.0,610.0," Harry, programmer and JavaScript."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",610.0,612.0, I said that the row span
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",612.0,614.0, of SAM is equal to 2.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",614.0,616.0, I said
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",616.0,618.0, that
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",618.0,620.0, the row span of my Java
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",620.0,622.0, will be 2.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",622.0,624.0, So here
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",624.0,626.0, Java will be 2.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",626.0,628.0, So here you can see Java has taken 2.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",628.0,630.0," So when Java has taken 2, I don't"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",630.0,632.0, want to write Java in the next one.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",632.0,634.0, Because its row is already in the next one.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",634.0,636.0, So I will not write Java in the next one.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",636.0,638.0, I have called it as Span 2.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",638.0,640.0, So what happened with this?
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",640.0,642.0," It was Harry, programmer and JavaScript."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",642.0,644.0, I said that the
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",644.0,646.0, call span of SAM
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",646.0,648.0, will be 2.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",648.0,650.0, This SAM will be 2.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",650.0,652.0, And Java will be 2.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",652.0,654.0, So you can see that it is exactly the same.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",654.0,656.0, It has taken 2.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",656.0,658.0," So this way, you can use"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",658.0,660.0, the row span and call span in HTML.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",660.0,662.0," In HTML table, we can add captions."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",662.0,664.0," And to add captions, we can"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",664.0,666.0, use the caption tag.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",666.0,668.0," So I will show you that in the table,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",668.0,670.0," if we use the caption,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",670.0,672.0, you can see the page
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",672.0,674.0, in this way.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",674.0,676.0, You can see that the
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",676.0,678.0, caption will be added here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",678.0,680.0, Now the CSS has also changed the font size.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",680.0,682.0," But for now, it looks like this."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",682.0,684.0, The caption is added.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",684.0,686.0, You will have to see the employee details in this way.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",686.0,688.0," Along with that, you can also add"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",688.0,690.0, header and footer. You can add
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",690.0,692.0, t-head and t-foot here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",692.0,694.0," For example, if I add"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",694.0,696.0," content in t-head and t-foot,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",696.0,698.0," like this, if I add"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",698.0,700.0," something like this, you will get"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",700.0,702.0, to see t-head and t-foot.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",702.0,704.0, You can see that the header and footer has come here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",704.0,706.0, Now I will tell you about another tag
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",706.0,708.0, called br tag which is used to add line break.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",708.0,710.0," So after the image, you can see that"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",710.0,712.0, there is a line break here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",712.0,714.0, So this is the header.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",714.0,716.0," And after that, I will add footer."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",716.0,718.0, I will not add it here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",718.0,720.0, So I will add the table after that.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",720.0,722.0, So this is my table footer.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",722.0,724.0, Now I can change it from CSS.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",724.0,726.0," Now here, I can group my header and footer content"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",726.0,728.0, in this way. So what will be
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",728.0,730.0," my table header that I have written here,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",730.0,732.0, I can group it. I can add it in
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",732.0,734.0," t-head. Along with that, the content"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",734.0,736.0, that will be in the table will come
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",736.0,738.0, in t-body. So what will come
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",738.0,740.0," in t-body? Something like this, my table"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",740.0,742.0, and content will come. Like you can see.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",742.0,744.0," And after this, if I write t-foot here."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",744.0,746.0, And I want to add some
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",746.0,748.0, data at the end. So I
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",748.0,750.0, will add another t-head. Like you can
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",750.0,752.0, see. I will write it and document it.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",752.0,754.0, Then it will be a better format.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",754.0,756.0, So I want to add t-head like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",756.0,758.0, And I want to group it in t-foot.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",758.0,760.0, So this is the way to group. I have
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",760.0,762.0, put some t-hearts in t-foot.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",762.0,764.0, I have put my main body
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",764.0,766.0, in t-heart. And I have put
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",766.0,768.0, my table header in t-head.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",768.0,770.0, And obviously nothing will change.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",770.0,772.0," I have just grouped it. Here,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",772.0,774.0, I will write footer here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",774.0,776.0, So that you will know that this is footer.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",776.0,778.0, I will write foot here. And you can
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",778.0,780.0, see that the last row is foot.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",780.0,782.0, What is the benefit of doing this? We have
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",782.0,784.0, targeted it from CSS.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",784.0,786.0, So you will use this very less.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",786.0,788.0, But you can do grouping like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",788.0,790.0, Your full table will come here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",790.0,792.0, Foot content will come here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",792.0,794.0, And body content comes in between.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",794.0,796.0, But you can write it here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",796.0,798.0," But ideally, head, body"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",798.0,800.0, and then foot comes.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",800.0,802.0, I hope you understood.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",802.0,804.0, So that's all about HTML tables.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",804.0,806.0, You don't need to know more.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",806.0,808.0, And now we will talk about
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",808.0,810.0, list. List is very important
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",810.0,812.0, in HTML. Because we will use
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",812.0,814.0, list a lot.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",814.0,816.0, There are three types of list in HTML.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",816.0,818.0, We have ordered list and unordered list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",818.0,820.0, And definition list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",820.0,822.0, The most used unordered and ordered list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",822.0,824.0, Let's see the unordered list first.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",824.0,826.0, Sometimes we want to have unordered
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",826.0,828.0, data. Like I write here UL.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",828.0,830.0, So I will write UL here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",830.0,832.0, That means unordered list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",832.0,834.0, I can write Li in this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",834.0,836.0, And I can write Harry. And then
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",836.0,838.0, I can write Rohan.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",838.0,840.0, And then I can write Shubham.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",840.0,842.0, So when I write
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",842.0,844.0," Harry Rohan Shubham,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",844.0,846.0, UL will come like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",846.0,848.0, Unordered list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",848.0,850.0, There is no order.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",850.0,852.0," There is no 1,2,3,4."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",852.0,854.0," But if I want it to be ordered,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",854.0,856.0, I can write this with
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",856.0,858.0, oil. If I make
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",858.0,860.0," its opening, closing tag with oil."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",860.0,862.0, And keep the rest same.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",862.0,864.0, Then it will be ordered list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",864.0,866.0," So here it will be 1,2,3."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",866.0,868.0, You can do capital ABC.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",868.0,870.0, You can do Roman numbers.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",870.0,872.0, You can do CSS help.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",872.0,874.0, You can see here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",874.0,876.0, UL is in this image.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",876.0,878.0, So it came like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",878.0,880.0, You can see in this image.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",880.0,882.0," It is in this. So it is 1,2,3."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",882.0,884.0, This is the definition list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",884.0,886.0, Definition list is very less used.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",886.0,888.0, It is a preview.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",888.0,890.0, I have added heading here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",890.0,892.0, I have written DL.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",892.0,894.0, DL means definition list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",894.0,896.0, And then DD.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",896.0,898.0, So here definition term is
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",898.0,900.0, definition of office.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",900.0,902.0, So it comes like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",902.0,904.0, You can change it with CSS.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",904.0,906.0, It is very less used.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",906.0,908.0, But you should know about it.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",908.0,910.0, Interview.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",910.0,912.0, You can ask what is definition list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",912.0,914.0, So it is a preview of this code.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",914.0,916.0, I am not writing it.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",916.0,918.0, But try it out.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",918.0,920.0, We will see the unordered list first.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",920.0,922.0," In unordered list, I have told you."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",922.0,924.0, You can customize it.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",924.0,926.0, By using type attribute.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",926.0,928.0," For example, if I square you."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",928.0,930.0, Type is equal to
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",930.0,932.0, I write you.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",932.0,934.0, So in UL type is equal to
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",934.0,936.0, I have written.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",936.0,938.0, It has appeared like a square.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",938.0,940.0," Similarly, I can"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",940.0,942.0, Circle the type in UL.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",942.0,944.0, I can do square.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",944.0,946.0, Disc by default.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",946.0,948.0, I can do square.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",948.0,950.0, I can do circle.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",950.0,952.0, Along with that.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",952.0,954.0, You can add any list of items.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",954.0,956.0, in this list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",956.0,958.0, Now let's see the unordered list.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",958.0,960.0," In the unordered list, you will write"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",960.0,962.0, Li. So it will come like this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",962.0,964.0, But you can use it.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",964.0,966.0, Type is equal to I.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",966.0,968.0," When you use type is equal to I, you will get"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",968.0,970.0, upper case roman numbers.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",970.0,972.0," Type is equal to I, you will get"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",972.0,974.0, lower case roman numbers.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",974.0,976.0," Type is equal to I, it is default."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",976.0,978.0, You don't need to do this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",978.0,980.0, You will get upper case alphabetical.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",980.0,982.0, So let's see this.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",982.0,984.0, Type is equal to I.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",984.0,986.0, We are giving examples.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",986.0,988.0, Suggestions.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",988.0,990.0, It is easy for us to see
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",990.0,992.0, the possible values.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",992.0,994.0, So it is very useful for VS Code.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",994.0,996.0, Many people use old editors.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",996.0,998.0, If you know their correct plugins.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",998.0,1000.0," If you have a lot of them, then do it."
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",1000.0,1002.0, VS Code is modern. Switch in VS Code.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",1002.0,1004.0, Everyone uses VS Code.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",1004.0,1006.0, You will see the developers using VS Code.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",1006.0,1008.0," If you want to do it in mobile,"
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",1008.0,1010.0, then comment in the replete.

5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",1018.0,1020.0," If you don't have much power and computer,"

5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",1024.0,1026.0, We will cover it in the coming videos.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",1026.0,1028.0, But I will stick it on VS Code.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",1028.0,1030.0, I hope you understood here.
5,"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML",1030.0,1032.0, We have completed 5 videos.

6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,81.2,84.60000000000001, So Google will only show those pages which will be fast.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,84.60000000000001,86.60000000000001, Information is very good.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,86.60000000000001,91.2," And along with that, there are some things that are good for users."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,91.2,92.8," For example, there are two pages from the editor."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,92.8,95.4, One page has told about dog food.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,95.4,97.80000000000001, The other page has also told exactly about dog food.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,97.80000000000001,101.4," But among these two, page 2 is very fast and loads well."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,101.4,103.0, So Google will give more preference to it.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,103.0,108.0," Along with that, there are core web vitals which Google considers to rank two pages."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,108.0,109.4," First of all, there is content."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,109.4,110.60000000000001, Content is the most important.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,110.6,115.6," If you have content on the other page, then you can rank it without the code web vitals."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,115.6,121.6," But if you are competing with a page with almost the same content,"
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,121.6,124.0, then you will see core web vitals.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,124.0,128.0," And if your core web vitals are good, then you will be given preference."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,128.0,131.0, So the first thing that comes in core web vitals is your CLS.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,131.0,134.4, You see this video here which I have run on the web.dev website.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,134.4,138.6, You will see that someone comes to your website and he is ordering to cancel it.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,138.6,142.2," So the time he canceled it, the above thing became visible."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,142.2,143.6, And he shifted the layout.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,143.6,144.79999999999998, And the order was completed.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,144.79999999999998,147.79999999999998, But the user wanted to click on the top if the order was not complete.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,147.79999999999998,149.79999999999998," In this way, the user experience is very bad."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,149.79999999999998,152.2," And as you saw in this video, this shouldn't happen."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,152.2,154.0, So our CLS should be at least.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,154.0,155.4, Now what is the definition of CLS?
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,155.4,159.6, Cumulative layout shift means how much the age is shifting while loading.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,159.6,163.4, Suppose you have loaded the page and you get to see this first.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,163.4,166.6," This was above and after that, when this part of the term was loaded,"
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,166.6,168.2, then all this shifted down.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,168.2,169.4, The layout shouldn't shift.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,169.4,172.2," If you put vit and ride in images, then the layout shouldn't shift."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,172.2,175.2, The next metric we are going to talk about is LCP.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,175.2,177.6, And LCP stands for largest contextual paint.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,177.6,181.4," This means that if a user is viewing a page, then the biggest element is on it."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,181.4,185.2," For example, the biggest part of this image is loading in how long."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,185.2,186.6, Meaning the entire page will be loaded.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,186.6,191.2, But the biggest element which is most important is loading in how long.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,191.2,195.4, The meaning of web.dev and Google should have a good LCP score of 2.5 seconds.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,195.4,198.6, Meaning the biggest element should be loaded in 2.5 seconds.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,198.6,201.0, After this comes the third metric which is FID.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,201.0,203.0, Which stands for first input delay.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,203.0,208.0, First input delay means that if a user clicks on an input element like button
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,208.0,212.0," or any type of input is given on a page, then how long does that input process?"
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,212.0,215.8," For example, if you click on a button, then the button click browser processes in how long?"
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,215.8,221.6, And the meaning of Google and web.dev should start processing at least 100 milliseconds.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,221.6,224.4, So these were three core web vitals which are very important.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,224.4,227.8, I will tell you about the information that these core web vitals are updated.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,227.8,230.4, But these three are very important and you should know.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,230.4,234.0, Now I will show you what light house report is and why it is generated.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,234.0,237.0, And how these three core web vitals value will be given from there.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,237.0,238.4, So I will tell you here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,238.4,246.0," If you will inspect it right click and if you can see it on the right side, then you can click here and run it."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,246.0,249.8, You can bring it here again and you can run it here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,249.8,253.4, I prefer to see it down because it is my habit to see it from the beginning.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,253.4,256.2, Now here you can see the option of light house.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,256.2,262.2, Light house basically generates a report and tells you what can be improved in your HTML page.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,262.2,268.0," For example, if I want to see in mobile that how mobile users see my website."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,268.0,272.2, So I will click on mobile or I will click on desktop and I will close this tab.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,272.2,275.0, I will click on mobile and here I will click on analyze page load.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,275.0,277.2, So this will generate a report for me in light house.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,277.2,279.2, You can see here that a report has been generated.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,279.2,284.0," Performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO and PWA are all shown here."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,284.0,287.2, Now you can see here that some things are showing in red.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,287.2,289.4, That is the scope of improvement in the page.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,289.4,292.2, Now here you can see that properly size your images.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,292.2,295.2, 2.7 seconds fast your website can be loaded.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,295.2,299.0, So all these suggestions are given to you by light house.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,299.0,306.0," And if you incorporate these suggestions, then your website will be loaded very well and the user will have a good experience."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,306.0,309.4, Now you can see here that image elements do not have explicit width and height.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,309.4,311.4, So you should give width and height.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,311.4,315.2, The width and height attribute of image that we had read in the previous video should be used.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,315.2,318.2, So that it is reserved in your browser.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,318.2,322.0," When we set width and height in HTML, then space in the browser is reserved."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,322.0,328.4," Otherwise, if we do not set height and width, then what will happen that our browser will not tell us how much space we have to reserve."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,328.4,332.4," And the longer the CSS load, the lower the page will shift."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,332.4,335.0, So we do not want our page to shift during loading time.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,335.0,341.0," If our page starts shifting, then if we click here, then when it will shift from the wrong side, then it can be done."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,341.0,343.0, We click here and sit.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,343.0,345.0," Suppose there was an image here, I click here."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,345.0,350.0," And the time I clicked here, this image was loaded and all these buttons were shifted down."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,350.0,353.0," And instead of clicking here, I will click on the image."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,353.0,355.0, This is called cumulative layout shift.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,355.0,358.0, So this kind of shift is not preferred at all.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,358.0,360.0, Google does not prefer at all.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,360.0,361.0, And this should be at least.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,361.0,363.0, You can see that the space is very less.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,363.0,367.0, So we have to keep the cumulative layout shift at least so that our user can get a very good experience.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,367.0,371.0, So here we get a lot more suggestions and this is for our mobile.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,371.0,373.0, Now we can generate desktop reports.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,373.0,374.0, And that will generate desktop reports.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,374.0,378.0, So as you can see that it has generated a report.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,378.0,379.0, 92 marks in performance.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,379.0,381.0, There are 82 in accessibility.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,381.0,383.0, 75 in best practices.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,383.0,384.0, And 75 in SEO.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,384.0,386.0, Now here you can see that all the good things are told here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,386.0,388.0, And all the lighthouses from the scope of improvement.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,388.0,392.0, So this is a hidden tool that we should use.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,392.0,395.0, Now I want to tell you about meta tags and meta description.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,395.0,397.0, So what will I do here is that I will make a new file.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,397.0,399.0, I will name it index.html.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,399.0,404.0," And after making one HTML file, the first SEO element that I want to tell you is title."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,404.0,407.0, Your title reflects your page content.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,407.0,409.0, So this is a very good SEO practice.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,409.0,412.0," Whenever your page change is happening, you make the title like this."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,412.0,414.0, That reflects your page content.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,414.0,417.0," Because if you want your website on Google, then that title will come according to you."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,417.0,421.0, You can write the code with the index of Google here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,421.0,424.0," And if you write like this, then this is the title of the page."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,424.0,427.0, And this is the title of the page that YouTube has put in.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,427.0,429.0, This is the title of the page that Instagram has put in.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,429.0,431.0, This is the title of the page that GitHub has put in.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,431.0,437.0, So if you put the title on the page and the title reflects your page content in actual.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,437.0,440.0, Then your website will rank very well.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,440.0,442.0, Now here I will put the content.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,442.0,445.0, And I will put an H1 and write Harry here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,445.0,448.0, And after that I will write a paragraph here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,448.0,450.0, And here I will write Lorem45.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,450.0,452.0, Now I have written Lorem45.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,452.0,454.0, I will write the view word.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,454.0,456.0, Why did I write 45? This is a very good question.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,456.0,459.0, I wrote 45 because I have written Alci and 4 or 5.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,459.0,461.0, So I have given 4 or 5.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,461.0,463.0, I have written 23 because they are also around.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,463.0,464.0, So there is no other reason.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,464.0,466.0, Now I will quickly preview it here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,466.0,467.0, I will open in browser here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,467.0,468.0, See how it is showing.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,468.0,469.0, Now this document is written.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,469.0,472.0," If I leave it like this, then this is a good SEO practice."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,472.0,474.0, I will write about Harry here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,474.0,476.0, And I will write code with Harry here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,476.0,477.0, Which is my website.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,477.0,480.0, And what will happen if the title is reflected here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,480.0,481.0, Like you all see.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,481.0,483.0, So what will happen if you do this?
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,483.0,487.0, That my website will increase the chances of seeing in Google.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,487.0,489.0," After inspecting, I will also take out its light house report."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,489.0,491.0, And I will see what is the scope of improvement.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,491.0,493.0, The light house report will be very good.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,493.0,496.0, Because there is no such thing that I should improve.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,496.0,498.0," But when I put images, I will get suggestions."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,498.0,500.0," Like put width, height."
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,500.0,503.0," Along with that, I will tell you another trick."

6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,517.0,519.0, So your website is responsive.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,519.0,521.0, You can see it here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,521.0,523.0, If you want to see in a specific device.

6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,524.0,526.0, Your website is iPhone 12 Pro.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,526.0,528.0, Resolution will look something like this.

6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,576.0,578.0, Now I will tell you about meta text.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,578.0,580.0, Here I will write meta.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,580.0,582.0, Here meta DESC is coming.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,582.0,584.0, I will click on meta DESC.

6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,591.0,592.0, Description.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,592.0,593.0, About.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,593.0,594.0, Harry.

6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,595.0,598.0, And here you can write any page content.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,598.0,599.0, Whatever you want.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,599.0,601.0, Suppose you write what is SEO.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,601.0,602.0, Okay.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,602.0,603.0, What is SEO.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,603.0,604.0, You wrote what is SEO.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,604.0,605.0, Look here.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,605.0,607.0, This page has put this meta description.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,607.0,609.0, SEO stands for this in simple terms.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,609.0,611.0, Now it is not necessary that a search engine.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,611.0,612.0, Passes your meta DESC.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,612.0,613.0, It will not do this.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,613.0,614.0, If it feels good.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,614.0,616.0, It will pass and keep your meta DESC.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,616.0,618.0, If you have not put meta DESC.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,618.0,620.0, Then it can be generated from your content.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,620.0,621.0, Meta DESC.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,621.0,623.0, So this is the responsibility of a search engine.
6,SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML,623.0,624.0, What will Bing do.

7,Forms and input tags in HTML,0.0,4.9," In this video, we will learn about the forms and what is the input tag in the form."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,4.9,11.3, It is very important to use the form for websites because you submit the data through the form from client to server.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,11.3,16.1," These are the forms that you see on the contact pages, on Google forms or inquiry forms."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,16.1,23.0," On the flight or railway ticket, we submit all the details through the HTML forms."

7,Forms and input tags in HTML,54.3,57.1," I will take a 6th right, open with code."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,57.1,58.7, I have already told you all this.

7,Forms and input tags in HTML,63.9,70.7," I will do the view, word wrap, screen, mode on, and you see here, I will write forms."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,70.7,72.3, Let's learn it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,72.3,75.7, So I have set the title here of the form page.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,75.7,80.2," And what happened by setting the title, that the title will be shown in actual on our page."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,80.2,83.8," Here, I want to tell you a very important setting, the show preview."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,83.89999999999999,88.39999999999999," So, in the beginning, they had also pointed out to me that every time you have to click so many times,"
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,88.39999999999999,89.39999999999999, can you do something?

7,Forms and input tags in HTML,119.0,123.0," But now I want to tell you that as soon as we click here, it opens."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,123.0,125.0," So if you want, then do it like this."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,125.0,128.0, But sometimes you prefer side by side view.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,128.0,132.5," And when will you want to do that when you are actually using HTML, CSS or working on design."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,132.5,137.5," So whenever you are working on design, you definitely want to see the live preview."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,137.6,141.6, Which is why this extension was made and it was made differently from the live server.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,141.6,143.6, That's why it will be seen in every side preview.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,143.6,146.6," Now what will we do here, we will know about forms."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,146.6,148.1, What is form?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,148.1,153.1," You know the name of the form, which means the form of the railway, we go and get our reservation."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,153.1,158.1," Along with that, we increase the form of the IDJ, the form of the need, the form of any exam."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,158.1,161.1, So that we can reach our data to the one we want.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,161.1,163.1," Okay, so this is form."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,163.2,164.7, HTML is a form tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,164.7,168.7," Like you will write a form, enter it, the first question will be like this."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,168.7,170.7, What is your form action? Get or post?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,170.7,172.7, Get request or post request?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,172.7,174.7, I will tell you a very quick difference.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,174.7,176.7, I will see this thing in the future when we will read it back and forth.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,176.7,178.7, Get request is a very simple request.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,178.7,183.7," And post request, we send in most of the cases when we have to give a lot of data."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,183.7,188.7," Like when we have to post a form, we will use post request in most of the cases."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,189.29999999999998,191.29999999999998, And get request is a very simple request.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,191.29999999999998,195.29999999999998, That we just have to tell the server and that's it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,195.29999999999998,197.29999999999998, Or we have to hit the server with a request.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,197.29999999999998,198.29999999999998, That's it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,198.29999999999998,200.29999999999998," But if you still don't understand it, that should be fine."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,200.29999999999998,204.29999999999998, There is no problem because we are going to do it in detail in the future.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,204.29999999999998,206.29999999999998, So form action is equal to post.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,206.29999999999998,209.29999999999998, Now I can show you some input tags.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,209.29999999999998,211.29999999999998, I will tell you the input tags.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,211.29999999999998,215.29999999999998, What are the elements inside your form?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,215.3,224.3," Like you can put a date, you can put it in the form, you can tell the name, you can tell the phone number, you can say your age, you can say your number."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,224.3,227.3, You want to put such things in the form.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,227.3,231.3, So I want to tell you that you put input tags in the form.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,231.3,235.3, And a label tag which is used to label that input.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,235.3,239.3, So what I will do here is the simplest input tag is type is equal to text.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,239.3,242.3, So I will put the type is equal to text input here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,242.3,249.3," And if I zoom out here, then the input type is equal to text name is equal to user name, place will enter user name."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,249.3,251.3, And this will actually look like this.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,251.3,257.3, That is you can say enter your user name and the user name in front of you will have to enter the user name.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,257.3,260.3, I will write an H1 here and I will write here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,260.3,268.3, So here is the form to apply for T.A. for Sigma Web Dev T.A.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,268.3,273.3, Sigma Web Development Codes T.A.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,273.3,277.3, So we are hiring teaching assistants for Sigma Web Development Codes.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,277.3,279.3, So we can write here something like this.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,279.3,283.3," By the way, I have put subtitles. If you haven't done the playlist, then do access it."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,283.3,286.3," And along with that, I will show you one more thing."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,286.3,291.3, I have written Sigma Batch Open and I have written the end game of village land.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,291.3,294.3," If someone is watching this, or if someone is watching this, or if someone is watching this,"
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,294.3,299.3," or if someone is not understanding Hindi, then it is fine to watch this and give your village land to me."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,299.3,304.3," Anyway, you can see here that I have put the H1 here because it is our main heading."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,304.3,306.3, Enter your user name. This is our input tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,306.3,308.3," Along with the input tag, we use the label tag."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,308.3,311.3, Now whose label is this? So I will write its ID.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,311.3,314.3, I will write its ID username.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,314.3,319.3, And what will I do in 4 is equal to? I will put its ID in 4 is equal to.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,319.3,322.3, Now what is the ID here? I will tell you this later.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,322.3,325.3," For now, you just have to understand that this element is a unique identifier."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,325.3,330.3," To identify this element uniquely, like your basic number cannot be of anyone else."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,330.3,333.3," Similarly, this ID username has been found. Now it cannot be of anyone else."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,333.3,335.3, This is the ID. I will tell you more in detail.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,335.3,338.3, But now understand this much. So I have written the label for is equal to user name.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,338.3,342.3, I have written the input here and you can see that the label here will come.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,342.3,345.3, So I am looking here. I have not put anything in the label.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,345.3,348.3, So I will put enter your user name.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,348.3,352.3," And you can see here that as soon as I put this, you will get to see enter your user name."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,352.3,354.3, After that you can enter your user name.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,354.3,357.3," Along with that, you can enter your expertise here."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,357.3,360.3, You can also put anything. I know that I have to ask here what is your gender.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,360.3,362.3, So I can do something like this here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,362.3,367.3," And you see enter your gender. And as soon as I did this, I can ask you whether it is male or female."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,367.3,370.3, Now what happens here is that sometimes we wrap it in div.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,370.3,374.3, What is div? Div is our block element.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,374.3,379.3, And what are the inline block elements? I have not told you in this course yet.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,379.3,381.3, But I will tell you in the coming videos.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,381.3,384.3, So for now you will understand this much. I am putting this in div to give a new space.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,384.3,386.3," So as soon as I put this in div, it will come in the new space."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,386.3,388.3," Yes, there is a BR tag too."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,388.3,390.3," There is a BR tag too, which is the line break."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,390.3,393.3, But I don't prefer BR tag. And you will get to know why.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,393.3,397.3, Because we don't want to bloat our HTML from BR tags.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,397.3,399.3, You will get to know this in the coming videos.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,399.3,403.3," Now you see here the entry of user name, here the male or female."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,403.3,407.3," Now here as soon as I am clicking on female, this radio button is selected."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,407.3,409.3, I am clicking on male and it is selected.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,409.3,414.3, Why is this happening? Because the label of this is equal to female and here the id is female.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,414.3,418.3," You see. And along with that, I have put the names of both of them."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,418.3,421.3, So here the name is equal to gender. I have also put this input tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,421.3,425.3, And the name is equal to gender. I have also put this input radio tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,425.3,428.3," And as soon as we have written type is equal to radio, it means the radio button."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,428.3,432.3," And if we have put the same name, then only one at a time can be selected."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,432.3,435.3," If I have selected this, then it will be this. If I have selected this, then it will be this."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,435.3,439.3, Now I will show you one thing. If I mess up the id in the form of the label.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,439.3,442.3," And here too in the form id, I do not mess up the first one."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,442.3,444.3, I mess up the second one.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,444.3,447.3," So when I click on the second one, it will not be selected."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,447.3,450.3, I am clicking and not selecting. I am clicking and selecting on the male.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,450.3,453.3," So to select the female, I will have to click on this here."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,453.3,459.3," See, I should always do it. For is equal to, the input tag should be the id."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,459.3,462.3, So you can see here I have put the label for is equal to female.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,462.3,466.3," Along with that, we have an input tag which is type is equal to checkbox."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,466.3,469.3," Now see here, if I put the input of type is equal to checkbox."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,469.3,473.3, I will put this in the div. And I will do it as I will do the format document.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,473.3,475.3, Our document will be very good.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,475.3,478.3," That is, its formatting will be very good from the end."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,478.3,482.3," Now here see, here I can check the subscribe to newsletter."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,482.3,487.3, And the difference between the radio button and the checkbox is that you can check the checkbox.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,487.3,493.3," If you want, you can select one of the male or female options."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,493.3,496.3, After that we have the text area and the select tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,496.3,498.3, And I will show you that too.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,498.3,501.3, So this is the text area and the select tag works as it is.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,501.3,503.3, Like I am copying text area.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,503.3,506.3, And I will put it here and show you the text area.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,506.3,508.3, So text area input type is equal to text.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,508.3,513.3," But in this, there is a row and column attribute which helps you to reduce the size of it."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,513.3,516.3, Now here see the placeholder of it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,516.3,518.3, Enter your comment here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,518.3,520.3, So I have given the text here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,520.3,522.3," Ideally, we will keep it empty."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,522.3,524.3, Or at least we will not give a new line to it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,524.3,526.3, So I will hide it here. Enter your comment here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,526.3,528.3, And now it will reach to the left side.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,528.3,529.3, I will show you.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,529.3,531.3, So it has reached to the left side.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,531.3,532.3, Enter your comment here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,532.3,534.3, And here any user can put their comment.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,534.3,537.3, Now see I have put the content of the text area.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,537.3,538.3, Enter your comment here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,538.3,541.3, So ideally you do not want to empty the text area.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,541.3,543.3, And you want to put a label.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,543.3,546.3, And you can say that the label for is equal to comment.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,546.3,548.3, And we will definitely put id here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,548.3,551.3," Whenever we put for, then it is in for."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,551.3,553.3, The element for which it has its id.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,553.3,554.3, Now see here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,554.3,557.3, Enter your comment here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,557.3,559.3, So what will happen?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,559.3,561.3, Enter your comment here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,561.3,562.3, Enter your comment here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,562.3,564.3, Now you will see that this is not styled.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,564.3,566.3, This is not styled.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,566.3,568.3, Because we will style it with CSS later.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,568.3,570.3, Now for this I will just put br tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,570.3,572.3, But I do not recommend br tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,572.3,573.3, I am telling you again.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,573.3,575.3, I do not recommend br tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,575.3,577.3, Because br tags are difficult.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,577.3,579.3," By the way, you should know br tag."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,579.3,580.3, Line break tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,580.3,581.3, Line break is something like this.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,581.3,583.3, You are doing everything now.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,583.3,585.3, What is the problem in br tag?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,585.3,586.3, But I will tell you.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,586.3,588.3, Br tag is something that I do not recommend.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,588.3,589.3, It is not like that.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,589.3,590.3, You do not have to use it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,590.3,591.3, But I do not recommend using it all the time.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,591.3,592.3, What happens now?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,592.3,593.3, People think it is the easiest thing.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,593.3,596.3, Put br tag and add new spaces.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,596.3,598.3, I will post a lot of these things.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,598.3,599.3, So I will copy it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,599.3,600.3, I will show you the select tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,600.3,601.3, Something like this.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,601.3,603.3, And you see here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,603.3,605.3, As soon as I put select tag here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,605.3,606.3, I put it in div.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,606.3,607.3, So what happens in select?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,607.3,608.3, You get some options.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,608.3,611.3, Select syntax is something like this.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,611.3,612.3, Make apple.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,612.3,615.3, And you can use any of the three from cherry.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,615.3,616.3, Now you see here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,616.3,617.3, Anyone of the three can use it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,617.3,618.3, And what I did here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,618.3,619.3, Value is equal to apple.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,619.3,620.3, First I made a select tag.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,620.3,622.3, Name is equal to fruits.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,622.3,624.3, Then option value is equal to apple.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,624.3,626.3, Option value is equal to banana.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,626.3,627.3, Option value is equal to cherry.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,627.3,630.3, When we pass this form data.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,630.3,632.3, I will tell you in the JavaScript part.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,632.3,634.3, How to send this data to the server.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,634.3,637.3, There are many things about form that are still there.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,637.3,638.3, I will tell you.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,638.3,640.3, So stay tuned for that.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,640.3,641.3, This was about forms.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,641.3,644.3, I had to tell you all the elements of form in this video.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,644.3,647.3, And along with that I have told you all the select tags.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,647.3,650.3, I have told you all the other attributes about form.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,650.3,651.3, Like action.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,651.3,655.3, You can submit the form to any page from action.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,655.3,656.3, Where will you handle the form?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,656.3,658.3, You can give that data here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,658.3,660.3, Then there is a method called get request or post request.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,660.3,662.3, I will tell you in the video of difference in these two.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,662.3,664.3, But I have told you in a very rough way.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,664.3,666.3, Get request is a very simple request.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,666.3,669.3, Post request is used only when the server has to send big data.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,669.3,671.3, Because there is a limit of get request.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,671.3,673.3, You can send a lot of data in post request.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,673.3,674.3, Okay.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,674.3,676.3, We don't send passwords in get request.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,676.3,678.3, We send it along with the post request.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,678.3,679.3, Okay.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,679.3,681.3, Now here I have told you the method.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,681.3,682.3, What is the name?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,682.3,683.3, Name is equal to user name.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,683.3,685.3, We mark it with name.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,685.3,689.3," If we mark it with name, then the server will know the corresponding value of key."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,689.3,692.3, So the key value that will go to the server will go according to the name.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,692.3,693.3, Its name and value will go.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,693.3,696.3, We will also see this when we do server side processing.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,696.3,697.3, What is the meaning of placeholder?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,697.3,699.3, Placeholder means what will be written in it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,699.3,701.3, Like here entry and user name is placeholder.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,701.3,702.3, I will click on it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,702.3,705.3, So this entry and user name is not written in it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,705.3,706.3, I will write anything.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,706.3,707.3," Look, this is it."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,707.3,709.3, But the entry and user name is just telling me here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,709.3,711.3, I have to put user name in it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,711.3,714.3, Then what is required is that you have to require it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,714.3,715.3, You will have to put it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,715.3,716.3, You will have to put the value of it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,716.3,718.3, Otherwise your form will not submit.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,718.3,719.3, So we will use this a lot.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,719.3,722.3, Then after this we have autofocus.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,722.3,725.3, Autofocus automatically focuses the cursor.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,725.3,728.3, So I will show you the magic of autofocus.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,728.3,731.3, So if you have written here input tag in the autofocus.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,731.3,732.3, Okay.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,732.3,734.3, So I have written autofocus in the entry and user name.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,734.3,735.3, I will reload it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,735.3,736.3," So look, I will type it."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,736.3,738.3, So it will automatically focus on it.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,738.3,743.3, So autofocus means that you type here whenever you type.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,743.3,744.3, Okay.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,744.3,746.3, I hope you understand things.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,746.3,747.3, Now validation attribute.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,747.3,749.3, I have told you the requirement here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,749.3,752.3, You can give a pattern in which you can give a regular expression pattern.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,752.3,754.3, Now you people do not get confused.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,754.3,755.3, You do not say what is this.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,755.3,757.3, You do not get regular expression.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,757.3,758.3, So I am sitting here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,758.3,759.3, I will teach you all things.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,759.3,763.3, So you understand that we will accept a particular pattern.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,763.3,764.3, If we put the pattern equal to this.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,764.3,767.3, So you cannot put it apart from this pattern.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,767.3,768.3, Okay.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,768.3,771.3, So you should know this thing here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,771.3,773.3, So I hope you are enjoying this video.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,773.3,777.3," And along with that, I will write a sigma batch op in the comment section."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,777.3,780.3," And in the first video, please review this course."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,780.3,784.3, Because still a lot of people ask me whether I should do this course or not.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,784.3,786.3," If it is free course, people do not value it."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,786.3,787.3, They say this course is free.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,787.3,790.3, So we should watch it or take a paid course.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,790.3,795.3, I would like to give a note for those people who asked me to take a paid course.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,795.3,796.3, What should I do now?
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,796.3,800.3, Take the money or join the sigma batch.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,800.3,801.3, Join the sigma batch.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,801.3,803.3, Join the cut your losses and sigma batch.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,803.3,806.3, Because look at the quality of this course.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,806.3,808.3, I do not think you need to tell me.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,808.3,810.3, So you do this.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,810.3,812.3, You will get everything here.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,812.3,813.3, I am telling you.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,813.3,816.3," Free means I understood that this course was going to sell you for 10,000 rupees."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,816.3,818.3," Yes, that was the amount that we fixed."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,818.3,820.3," I was going to sell you this course for 10,000 rupees."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,820.3,822.3, And I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,822.3,825.3," If anyone is selling, there is nothing wrong in selling any course."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,825.3,831.3," But the thing is, if you buy a second course and you still feel that the sigma batch is very good."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,831.3,833.3, You should join.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,833.3,834.3, Join the cut your losses and join.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,834.3,838.3," Because if you make your career once, you will not get anything in the future."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,838.3,842.3," If you look back at the time when you came, you will also say that we took a paid course."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,842.3,844.3, Then we took a pre-coach.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,844.3,848.3," And if you become a career once, then everything will not matter in the future."
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,848.3,850.3, So do what is right for you.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,850.3,852.3, And you understand your mistakes.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,852.3,853.3, Do work.
7,Forms and input tags in HTML,853.3,855.3, I hope you understand things.

8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,0.0,3.72, Learning the concept of Inline and Block Elements in HTML is very important.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,3.72,6.5600000000000005, Inline elements are those which are required to take the width of the screen.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,6.5600000000000005,9.92, And Block Elements are those which take the entire width of the screen.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,9.92,13.32, It is also called Display Property which can be set through CSS.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,13.32,16.72, If you are enjoying this video so far then do like this video.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,16.72,20.04, So let's go to the computer screen and look closely at Inline and Block Elements.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,20.04,23.28," Through some very good examples, let's roll the intro."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,31.0,35.0," So guys, we are now at Inline and Block Elements."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,35.0,38.0, If you haven't accessed the playlist and haven't accessed the code then do both.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,38.0,45.0," Because as soon as the videos are being made, the code and video are being added to the playlist."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,45.0,50.0, Now I will quickly make a folder called Video 8.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,50.0,53.0, So I have already added 7 videos here.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,53.0,57.0, I will make a video 8 and open it in VS Code.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,57.0,65.0," After opening it, I will tell you about the index and block elements by turning on index.html."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,65.0,71.0, I have entered the exclamation mark and I could type this but I will not do it because it is a Y type.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,71.0,74.0, I will write here inline and block elements.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,74.0,79.0, I have told you a little about this but I will add more details to it.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,79.0,82.0, What are the inline elements and why I want to use them.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,82.0,87.0," So look at the inline elements, they are only the amount of width that is required."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,87.0,90.0, Do block elements not take as much width as required? No.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,90.0,92.0, They say we need the entire width.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,92.0,96.0, Some people just sit with the file and the block elements are like that.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,96.0,98.0, I will tell you what is the difference between them.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,98.0,103.0," To explain this difference, I will cheat a little and add CSS."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,103.0,106.0, You might ask why I am not teaching CSS?
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,106.0,110.0, I am adding CSS only as much as it is required.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,110.0,116.0, I will write P and enter here.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,116.0,119.0, Let us say I am a para.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,119.0,123.0, I will tell you to give P as background color.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,123.0,125.0, Let us say blue.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,125.0,129.0, I will give you a good color choice.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,129.0,132.0, Now you can see that I have given a color to para graph.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,132.0,134.0, I will also add anchor tag.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,134.0,138.0, I will add href is equal to google.com.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,138.0,140.0, I will add sttps to it.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,140.0,145.0, I will write google.com.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,145.0,150.0, And I will give the anchor tag in background color.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,150.0,152.0, I will give background color red.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,152.0,154.0, But I will not do red.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,154.0,157.0, I can choose any color in the spectrum.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,157.0,159.0, How did you like the Ninja tagging?
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,159.0,163.0," If you already know Ninja tagging, then comment."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,163.0,169.0, You can see that I have given the anchor tag in background color.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,169.0,173.0, I have changed it to red.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,173.0,175.0, I have added it to red orange.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,175.0,177.0, And I have added blue.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,177.0,179.0, Now you can see the difference.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,179.0,184.0," I will click here and as soon as I click here, you can see that the background color is the same as the entire width."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,184.0,187.0, But it is the same as the element.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,187.0,188.0, Why did this happen?
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,188.0,191.0, Because this is the paragraph block element.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,191.0,193.0, And our anchor tag is inline element.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,193.0,196.0, Inline elements are only taken as much as they want.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,196.0,198.0, Block elements are taken as the entire width.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,198.0,200.0, And the next content comes below them.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,200.0,203.0," When they come below the entire width, then the next content will come below them."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,203.0,206.0," Along with that, if I talk about dev, what is that?"
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,206.0,208.0, A block element.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,208.0,210.0, I am a block element.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,210.0,213.0, And span is like a dev.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,213.0,215.0, But it is an inline element.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,215.0,218.0, I am span and I am inline.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,218.0,223.0," And if I click here and write yes, he is inline."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,223.0,225.0, So you can see here.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,225.0,227.0, I will zoom out the code.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,227.0,229.0, So if I write it in new line.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,229.0,231.0," By the way, I will tell you how many spaces I have given."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,231.0,233.0, This will not be added in my content.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,233.0,236.0, Because HTML is more than one space.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,236.0,238.0, And it does not include it.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,238.0,242.0," If you want to give spaces, you can write amper and nbsp."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,242.0,244.0, I will tell you about that.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,244.0,246.0, But now I want to show you how it works.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,246.0,248.0, So see what happened?
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,248.0,250.0, I have written amper.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,250.0,252.0, A block element.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,252.0,254.0, The next content will come below.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,254.0,257.0, I have written this as much as it is necessary.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,257.0,261.0, And the next content is that I want the entire width.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,261.0,263.0, So it will not come here.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,263.0,265.0, It will come in the next line.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,265.0,267.0, Because it says that I want the entire width.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,267.0,269.0, So it will not come in the next line.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,269.0,271.0, Because how will it come in this line?
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,271.0,273.0, It will take the entire width.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,273.0,275.0," If I give it a background color, it will be in the entire width."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,275.0,277.0, I will give it a yellow color.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,277.0,279.0, It has a background color.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,279.0,281.0, And I give it a background color.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,281.0,285.0," And you see here, this yellow is the entire width."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,285.0,290.0," Along with that, I can keep the span and anchor tag in the same line."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,290.0,292.0, Because it is an inline element.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,292.0,294.0, So the only width is as much as it is necessary.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,294.0,298.0, And it gives the opportunity to come in its own width.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,298.0,302.0," As you saw here, this span also gave the opportunity to come in its own width."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,302.0,305.0, Now will the anchor tag be inline?
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,305.0,307.0, Will the paragraph tag always block?
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,307.0,308.0, Will this always happen?
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,308.0,310.0," The answer is no, you can change it."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,310.0,315.0, You can set a particular element of the display property from the CSS.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,315.0,317.0," And if you set the display property,"
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,317.0,320.0, It is not necessary that the inline element will be blocked.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,320.0,322.0, And the block element will be blocked.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,322.0,324.0, It can be inline.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,324.0,325.0, We will see this in the CSS.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,325.0,327.0, Now I want to pinpoint one thing quickly.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,327.0,329.0, The video of the forms was video 7.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,329.0,332.0, But I have put it in the folder called video 6.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,332.0,334.0, So I will do video 7.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,334.0,336.0, And now it is video 8.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,336.0,338.0, What we are doing now is video 8.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,338.0,340.0, And nothing is in video 7.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,340.0,343.0, So I will quickly structure it here.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,343.0,344.0, Don't worry about it.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,344.0,346.0, I hope you are getting a lot of learnings.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,346.0,349.0, A lot of people have pointed this thing in the comments.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,349.0,350.0, I will fix it.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,350.0,352.0, But I think that doesn't affect us in any way.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,352.0,353.0, Because you are getting it.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,353.0,358.0, And the folder you will get from the source code will be correct.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,358.0,362.0," Along with that, go to codewithary.com and download the notes."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,362.0,365.0, And that will be a complementary source for you.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,365.0,367.0, But I am explaining everything step by step.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,367.0,369.0, So don't worry about it.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,369.0,371.0, So this is our inline and block elements.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,371.0,374.0, Now which elements are inline and which blocks are inline.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,374.0,375.0, How will you know?
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,375.0,377.0, You will know how div is block and span is inline.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,377.0,379.0, So this comes with practice.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,379.0,382.0, But I have made a list of inline and block elements for you.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,382.0,384.0, Here is the list of block elements.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,384.0,388.0, In which I have written the most commonly used elements.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,388.0,389.0, Like div is used the most.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,389.0,390.0, Then it is a paragraph.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,390.0,392.0," And if you come to the end, you will get such elements."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,392.0,393.0, Which may not be used a lot.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,393.0,395.0, Maybe you don't even know about them.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,395.0,397.0, But you will know later.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,397.0,399.0, And tell all the elements that are not possible for me.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,399.0,401.0, So you have to do some self-learning.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,401.0,403.0, Definitely there are a lot of such elements.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,403.0,406.0, Which will come in very less use.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,406.0,408.0, But the most commonly used ones will be shown to you.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,408.0,411.0, Then I have made a list of inline elements.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,411.0,413.0, So you have to refer this comprehensive list.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,413.0,417.0, Here I have made a file named comprehensive list.txt.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,417.0,419.0, So refer this file.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,419.0,423.0, And you should not have any false space in the code.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,423.0,425.0, I was telling you that there is no space in it.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,425.0,429.0," In fact, if you write and document, then your document will be formatted."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,429.0,431.0, Write a good code.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,431.0,435.0," Write a code that in the coming time, when your grandson opens your laptop."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,435.0,439.0," And if they get this code, they say that grandfather used to write a good code."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,439.0,442.0, They would not say that grandfather used to put such a space.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,442.0,444.0, Then grandfather used to do this.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,444.0,446.0, They would do this.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,446.0,449.0, So you would want that you be handed over in good words.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,449.0,451.0, So write a good code.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,451.0,454.0, So that your grandson can hear you very good things.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,454.0,457.0," Now here through HTML comments, I want to give you a quiz."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,457.0,461.0," And this quiz is that without using br tag, write a vertically aligned form."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,461.0,463.0, Asking for name city.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,463.0,465.0, And here I have added one more thing.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,465.0,467.0, I will show you. I will turn on the word wrap.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,467.0,469.0," But look, name city and pin code off."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,469.0,470.0, So write a form.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,470.0,472.0," Because in the last video, we read about the form."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,472.0,474.0, You have to write this form.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,474.0,476.0, How will you make it?
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,476.0,477.0, You should know.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,477.0,481.0," And along with that, I want everyone to answer this in the comment section."
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,481.0,482.0, Everyone.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,482.0,483.0, This is our first quiz.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,483.0,486.0, So I want you to make a two-way interaction.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,486.0,489.0, Do write your code in the comment section.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,489.0,492.0, And tell me which element you used.

8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,500.0,502.0," In the upcoming videos, we will also see that using CSS,"
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,502.0,505.0," How can you set inline flex, inline block,"
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,505.0,507.0, This kind of display property.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,507.0,509.0, And what is the difference in that.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,509.0,511.0, So we will see all these things in the upcoming videos.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,511.0,514.0," I want to tell you that if you are following this course,"

8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,569.0,570.0, I did so much.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,570.0,572.0, I changed everything.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,572.0,573.0, You will not tell this.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,573.0,577.0, No one will tell you that it is worth the sacrifice that you are doing.

8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,583.0,584.0, They have sacrificed a lot.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,584.0,588.0, And people will never tell you that this sacrifice is worth it.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,588.0,589.0, You keep working hard.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,589.0,590.0, You are doing absolutely right.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,590.0,592.0, Don't think that you are missing out on this.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,592.0,593.0, You are missing out on that.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,593.0,594.0, Everything is done.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,594.0,595.0, I had to get this advice.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,595.0,597.0, This note is 4-5-100 rupees.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,597.0,598.0, Which I did not get.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,598.0,599.0, But it is okay.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,599.0,600.0, Let's move forward.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,600.0,601.0, I will do one thing.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,601.0,603.0, I will add a color to the span.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,603.0,604.0, I will write a span here.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,604.0,606.0, And I will add a background color here.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,606.0,607.0, I will add a color here.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,607.0,608.0, I will add a blue violet color.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,608.0,609.0, I will reduce it a little.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,609.0,611.0, I will click here and hover.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,611.0,612.0, Like this.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,612.0,613.0, And now you will see here.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,613.0,614.0, So look at this.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,614.0,616.0, This is how it has been highlighted.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,616.0,617.0, So for now in this video.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,617.0,620.0, I hope you have understood what the difference is on the inline and lock elements.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,620.0,621.0, Access the playlist.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,621.0,622.0, Like the video.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,622.0,624.0, Please access the code too.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,624.0,625.0, Do the same in your village.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,625.0,627.0, Thank you so much for watching this video.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,627.0,630.0, And I will see you next time.
8,Inline & Block Elements in HTML,636.0,637.0, Bye.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,0.0,3.04," In this video, I will tell you what are ID and classes."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,3.04,7.36, The concept of ID and classes is one of the concepts that are confused.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,7.36,12.24," In fact, when I was learning HTML in my early days, I was confused in the ID and classes."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,12.24,14.120000000000001, ID means unique identifier.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,14.120000000000001,18.8," If you give an ID to an element, you will not give it to another element."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,18.8,24.0," But the meaning of the class is that if you want to give multiple elements to a property,"
9,Id & Classes in HTML,24.0,25.560000000000002, you will give it multiple classes.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,25.560000000000002,29.76," For example, you can give a class called red, a div, and a form."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,29.76,35.24," Similarly, you can give an article and header tag of BG Red Nam class."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,35.24,41.72, Do like this video because we will go into the computer screen and we will see these things very closely.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,41.72,43.120000000000005, Let's roll the intro.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,52.64,54.44," Alright guys, I am back."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,54.44,58.92," If you have not accessed the Sigma Web Development codes, then access the playlist."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,58.92,61.199999999999996, Click here and save the file.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,61.199999999999996,63.879999999999995, And the source code is also being uploaded on GitHub.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,63.879999999999995,68.36, Now I will come here in the folder and make a folder of video number 9.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,68.36,70.56, I will make a folder of video 9.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,70.56,77.2," I will write video 9 and after making a folder of video 9, I will shift right click and open with code."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,77.2,79.8, And here you can see that this is open in BS code.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,79.8,82.16, I will write index.html here.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,82.16,84.12, I will put exclamation mark and enter.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,84.12,89.0, And now I will tell you what are ID and classes.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,89.0,91.08, You will have a basic card or not.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,91.08,92.96000000000001," If you do not have any ID, then you will have no ID."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,92.96000000000001,94.96000000000001, Now do not write in the comments that I do not have ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,94.96000000000001,98.12," Whenever you go to any place, you have to show ID."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,98.12,101.60000000000001," In some of the cases, to prove your identity."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,101.60000000000001,102.92, Here I am.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,102.92,109.52000000000001," Now if you want to understand ID and classes in the restaurant, then ID is your identity."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,109.52000000000001,111.76," Okay, what is your identity?"
9,Id & Classes in HTML,111.76,113.24000000000001, So listen to a story here.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,113.88,116.44, This is John and this is Harry.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,116.44,118.6, These are very good friends.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,118.6,120.28, They are very good friends.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,120.28,124.91999999999999, They do not share their lunch and the rest are good friends.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,124.91999999999999,129.48, They are not in the matter of food and they are friends in other matters.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,129.48,134.4, Now you can see that John and Harry have their own ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,134.4,140.92, So this is my ID and John's ID looks like this.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,141.0,144.6, So this is John's ID and this is my ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,144.6,147.07999999999998, Both of us can never have the same ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,147.07999999999998,152.64," Or if you consider that our friendship is made, then my friendship is made."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,152.64,156.27999999999997," Tania and John's friendship is made, then start."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,156.27999999999997,158.67999999999998, So their ID will also be different.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,158.67999999999998,161.32, And this is Tania's ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,161.32,163.04, This is Tania's ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,163.04,166.35999999999999," Now, each person's ID will be different."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,166.35999999999999,167.76, So John and Harry were friends.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,167.76,169.48, John's friend was made.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,169.48,171.35999999999999, This is Tania's ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,171.35999999999999,173.48, None of these four have the same ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,173.48,180.79999999999998," If you know any of these four ID, you will understand that Harry is the number 35, 34, 35, and 35."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,180.79999999999998,193.92," And if I say that John will be the number 35, 35, 36, and 35, then you will understand that Tania is the number 35."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,193.92,195.64, So this is uniquely identified.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,195.64,200.48," This is the number, Tania, Harry, Shruti, and John."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,200.48,204.76, So this is their ID and this is their ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,204.76,206.67999999999998, This number will not be found by anyone else.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,206.67999999999998,210.83999999999997," Along with that, John and Harry were childhood friends."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,210.83999999999997,213.32, They were both big and one class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,213.32,216.83999999999997, And the name of that class was class 10.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,216.83999999999997,219.0, Both of them are in class 10.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,219.08,220.48, Listen to me.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,220.48,222.16, Listen to me.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,222.16,225.44, And Shruti is in class 9.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,225.44,227.52, And Tania is in class 9.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,227.52,229.96, So both are in class 9.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,229.96,232.72, Tania is in class 9 and Shruti is in class 9.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,232.72,235.04, So what is Shruti's class 9?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,235.04,236.24, Tania's class can be 9.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,236.24,238.2," Now, Shruti will not have to study alone in class."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,238.2,240.36, Or Harry will not have to study alone in class 10.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,240.36,241.88, And there are other kids in class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,241.88,247.12, So the meaning of class is that Harry and John are in one class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,247.24,249.56, So can a class be a multiple of one person?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,249.56,251.72, A class can be a multiple of one person.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,251.72,254.20000000000002," For example, Malo, Harry is in class 10."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,254.20000000000002,257.8, And this goes into a tuition where this class is in class 10A.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,257.8,259.92, Malo's tuition also has classes.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,259.92,261.44, So more than one class can be.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,261.44,262.4, One is class 10.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,262.4,264.24, And one is class 10A.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,264.24,267.56," And along with that, Malo wears a red T-shirt."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,267.56,269.44, So his class is red too.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,269.44,271.52, So the class doesn't mean that he is going to study.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,271.52,274.08, The class means that he is classified in this class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,274.84,275.8, Now come here.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,275.8,277.59999999999997," Leave this John, Harry, Shruti."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,277.59999999999997,279.4," Okay, delete this."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,279.4,280.96, I will zoom out and delete it.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,280.96,282.84, It doesn't mean anything here.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,282.84,285.28, Now come to index.htm and understand this.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,285.28,287.08," Malo, I have made a div here."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,287.08,289.15999999999997, And I have given it a class red.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,289.15999999999997,291.28, And I have made a span.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,291.28,293.12, And I have given it a class red.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,293.12,296.2," Okay, I can give different elements to the classes I have given."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,296.2,297.4, Or I can give the same class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,297.4,300.12, But if I want to add an ID in any element.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,300.12,301.2," Malo, I have added an ID."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,301.2,302.2, His first div.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,302.2,303.68, I can add anything in the ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,303.76,304.56, So this is the idea.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,304.56,305.72, I don't give any other element.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,305.72,307.56, Because this is the basis of this element.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,307.56,309.76," If he has a second div, he can't add it."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,310.48,312.84000000000003, Then I will have to add something else.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,312.84000000000003,314.88," Okay, I have added a second div."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,314.88,318.04, And here I write a second and here I write a first.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,318.04,319.04, Okay.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,319.04,321.32, So this idea and the concept of classes.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,321.32,322.24, I personally don't know.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,322.24,323.44, I understood it very late.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,323.44,325.68, When I was learning about web development in my early days.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,325.68,329.76, I didn't tell anyone that ID unilkly identifies an element.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,329.76,330.96000000000004, And the class is
9,Id & Classes in HTML,331.03999999999996,334.4, It can also add multiple classes in one element.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,334.4,337.12, And it can also add one class in multiple elements.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,337.12,337.71999999999997, You understand?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,337.71999999999997,339.64, Like if I give it a red class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,339.64,341.79999999999995, I can give it a BGLO class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,341.79999999999995,343.64," Okay, BGLO."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,343.64,344.59999999999997, I can give it a class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,344.59999999999997,346.71999999999997, And if we give a class multiple elements.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,346.71999999999997,348.2, Then we put a space.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,348.2,352.64, Like if I want to add multiple classes in this element.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,352.64,353.76, Then what will I do?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,353.76,355.32, First I will write red here.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,355.32,357.28, Then I will put a space and write BGLO.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,357.28,359.44, So in this way I can give multiple classes.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,359.44,360.35999999999996, Same element.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,360.36,362.68, Can I give the same element multiple ID?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,362.68,364.56, Have you ever heard of someone's two-a-thar cards?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,364.56,366.68, I don't know if anyone made it or not.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,366.68,369.0, But it's not an ideality.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,369.0,372.0, The number of a-thar is one person.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,372.0,376.08000000000004, And the number of a-thar is different from a person.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,376.08000000000004,376.52000000000004, Okay?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,376.52000000000004,378.56, One person can't have multiple.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,378.56,380.88, Different people can't have the same.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,380.88,381.92, But the class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,381.92,384.40000000000003, If I say that you wear a t-shirt.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,384.40000000000003,386.36, Or you can wear a red t-shirt.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,386.36,387.08000000000004, No problem.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,387.08000000000004,388.8, If you go on the road.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,388.8,392.6, And let us say you like mango.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,392.6,393.88, Or you like banana.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,393.88,395.28000000000003, Or you like grapes.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,395.28000000000003,396.28000000000003, You will get multiple people.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,396.28000000000003,397.6, So consider that in banana class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,397.6,399.40000000000003, Or that is in grapes class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,399.40000000000003,399.8, Okay?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,399.8,400.88, Mango class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,400.88,403.04, So we can classify in one class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,403.04,405.40000000000003, And we can give one class to different elements.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,405.40000000000003,406.8, So I hope you understood this.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,406.8,408.24, Now I will write CSS here.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,408.24,410.8, And don't say that you are not studying CSS.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,410.8,412.04, What am I writing in CSS?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,412.04,412.72," You guys,"
9,Id & Classes in HTML,412.72,413.12," I mean,"
9,Id & Classes in HTML,413.12,415.32, I think I am writing some alien language.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,415.32,415.76, Okay?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,416.56,418.0, In style.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,418.0,420.0, But I am trying to make a point.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,420.0,421.44, I will click here.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,421.44,423.76, And here its preview is looking like this.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,423.76,424.76, First or second.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,424.76,425.92, I will show you one thing.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,425.92,427.4, One is class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,427.4,429.48, How do we target in CSS?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,429.48,430.48, We will dot.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,430.48,431.8, Dot red means red class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,431.8,433.64, And hash first div means.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,433.64,434.64, Hash means ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,434.64,436.32, Dot means class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,436.32,437.2, Okay?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,437.2,439.96, If I say that the first div.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,439.96,442.0, Color the background of it red.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,442.0,442.32, Okay?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,442.32,443.88, So if you color the background of first div.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,443.88,445.08, It will be red.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,445.08,445.68, Okay?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,445.68,447.48, These are the selectors in CSS.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,447.48,450.08000000000004, And now I don't want to confuse you.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,450.08000000000004,452.36, And I can comment like this in CSS.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,452.36,452.96000000000004, Okay?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,452.96000000000004,454.56, But we will read all these things.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,454.56,456.16, Now what will I do by dot red?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,456.16,458.16, I will write background color red.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,458.16,461.52000000000004, And what will I do in dot BGL?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,461.52000000000004,463.16, Dot BGL will be my dot.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,463.16,464.40000000000003, I have to put dot.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,464.40000000000003,465.40000000000003, Dot means class.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,465.40000000000003,467.24, It means class BGL.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,467.24,469.48, And I will yellow the background color.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,469.48,470.76," Sorry, I will color it."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,470.76,472.16, I will not color the background color.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,472.16,474.0, Dot red means color is red.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,474.0,475.16," Look, its color is red."
9,Id & Classes in HTML,475.16,476.76, And the background color is yellow.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,476.76,481.03999999999996, So you can use ID and classes in CSS like this.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,481.03999999999996,482.92, I hope you have understood something.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,482.92,485.56, Now one thing that you have to note here is that
9,Id & Classes in HTML,485.56,488.32, the ID and classes are attributes of the element.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,488.32,490.68, This is ID attribute and this is class attribute.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,490.68,492.2, So what are the ID classes?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,492.2,493.15999999999997, Are they elements or not?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,493.15999999999997,494.71999999999997, They are the attributes of elements.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,494.71999999999997,497.0, Now there is one more use of ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,497.0,499.15999999999997, I will tell you what is the use of ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,499.15999999999997,502.48, If I take you to Wikipedia and write the coding.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,502.48,504.12, So this page of Wikipedia.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,504.12,506.44, I will go to some other page on some other page.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,506.52,509.52, So you can see that when you go to any page on Wikipedia.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,509.52,510.8, So what can you do?
9,Id & Classes in HTML,510.8,513.2, You can take the link of that particular place.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,513.2,514.76, I will show you how it is.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,515.16,516.28, I go to some other page.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,516.28,517.84, I scroll down.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,517.84,521.2, And here I will inspect the ID of this.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,521.2,522.12, This is the ID of this.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,522.12,522.72, Okay.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,522.72,524.32, So I will copy this ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,524.32,524.76, Okay.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,524.76,528.56, And if I put here the hashtag and this ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,529.04,529.88, Now I will enter.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,529.88,531.24, So it will directly bring me here.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,531.24,532.12, In ICDA 8.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,532.12,534.28, So you see if I put it in incognito.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,534.3199999999999,537.64, It will show me that particular ID by scrolling.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,537.64,539.0, You see it will scroll.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,539.0,540.88, Instead of showing me this.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,540.88,542.1999999999999, It will scroll and show me.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,542.1999999999999,544.16, Because it wants to bring me to this ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,544.16,545.52, So it works in linking.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,545.52,546.1999999999999, So that is the ID.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,546.1999999999999,546.36, Okay.
9,Id & Classes in HTML,546.36,547.0, Keep this in mind.

10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",68.56,71.92, I will copy it here which is our video tag.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",71.92,77.03999999999999, It has an SRC attribute and some other attributes of it that I will discuss with you.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",77.03999999999999,81.75999999999999, But first I would like to tell you that video SRC is equal to what you have here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",81.84,84.52000000000001, So if you have video.mp4 then it will be played.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",84.52000000000001,85.96000000000001, I have video.mp4.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",85.96000000000001,90.88000000000001, So let's see. I have put it here with control and I will click here and preview it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",90.88000000000001,93.48, And you can see that this video has come.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",93.48,95.80000000000001, It is a very big video now.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",95.80000000000001,98.24000000000001, So what can I do? I can give it a width.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",98.24000000000001,101.88000000000001, So I can say that width is equal to 555 pixels.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",101.88000000000001,105.76," And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact I do not need to write PX."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",105.76,106.84, I will just do 555.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",106.84,109.4, As soon as we do not need to write PX in the image.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",109.4,111.72, Here we do not need to write PX here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",111.72,114.28, So as soon as I did width is equal to 555.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",114.28,117.52, In fact I do height is equal to 555.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",117.52,118.84, So that it becomes smaller.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",118.84,120.12, In fact I do it smaller.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",120.12,121.64, I do 255.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",121.64,122.88, And you see it has come here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",122.88,123.4, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",123.4,125.16, Now I will play it because I have put control.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",125.16,126.2, I can play it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",126.2,126.68, Look at this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",126.68,128.28, There is a better road than America.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",128.28,130.2, My name is Gopendra Jogi.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",130.2,131.12, Where have you been to in the US?

10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",132.88,133.76, Gopendra Jogi.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",135.68,138.24, So that way you can play video like this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",138.24,140.24, Now some attributes here are video tag.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",140.24,141.96, It is very simple to use video tag.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",141.96,143.36, You should have a video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",143.36,144.96, You have given the path of the video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",144.96,146.12, You have given the controls.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",146.12,147.0, So these controls will come.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",147.0,148.96, You can download it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",148.96,149.84, You can full screen.

10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",151.08,152.68, You can do picture in picture.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",152.68,154.8, All this automatically presents your browser.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",154.8,156.36, But let me tell you about some attributes.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",156.36,157.64000000000001, The first attribute is SRC.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",157.64000000000001,158.96, You know Giyal.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",158.96,160.24, Put the video here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",160.24,161.92000000000002, The name of the video file is SRC.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",161.92000000000002,164.88, This video file can also come from an external URL.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",164.88,165.44, You understand.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",165.44,168.88, If I have uploaded another video on Amazon S3.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",168.88,170.48, I can also put the URL there.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",170.48,171.35999999999999, I mean it is not necessary.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",171.35999999999999,175.56, The file can be on your server or third party.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",175.56,177.2, Now what controls do?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",177.2,179.56," Ads, video controls like play, pause and volume."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",179.56,182.12, Which we saw here in Gopendra Jogi's video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",182.12,185.2, That you are getting to see the controls here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",185.2,187.16, Now what is this thing?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",187.16,189.76, The browser automatically sees what control and
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",189.76,191.64, what will not be in your video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",191.64,193.0, Then see what will auto play.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",193.0,194.07999999999998, It will automatically play.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",194.07999999999998,195.2, As soon as the page loads.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",195.2,195.68, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",195.68,197.07999999999998, So if I put auto play here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",197.07999999999998,198.35999999999999, I will put auto play here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",198.36,199.36, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",199.36,201.08, Where do you see the road of the market?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",201.08,201.84, What is happening here?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",201.84,202.24, So see.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",202.24,202.96, How is it going here?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",202.96,203.76000000000002, It is good.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",203.76000000000002,205.68, So you can see that this is auto play here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",205.68,206.24, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",206.24,207.84, So I will put auto play here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",207.84,210.64000000000001, And our next attribute is loop.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",210.64000000000001,214.68, That is once our video is played.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",214.68,216.04000000000002, Then it will be loop.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",216.04000000000002,217.52, Like I will show you.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",217.52,220.48000000000002, Where do you see the road of the market?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",220.48000000000002,221.36, So this is again started.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",221.36,223.08, Once I finished this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",223.08,224.4, So this is again started by myself.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",224.4,224.68, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",224.68,227.36, So this loop works like this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",227.36,228.76000000000002, Next attribute is muted.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",228.76000000000002,230.12, Muted video is muted.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",230.12,231.92000000000002, So if I write here muted.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",231.92000000000002,233.60000000000002, Sometimes we want the video to be muted.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",233.60000000000002,237.08," In fact, when I add videos here on code with 3.com."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",237.08,238.44000000000003, And I demonstrate something.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",238.44000000000003,240.28, I am downloading VS code.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",240.28,241.96, So I use muted attribute.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",241.96,244.12, But I don't want that when I recorded a video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",244.12,246.12," If there is any background noise, they will tell you."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",246.12,248.56," For example, I want to show you that this is the element."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",248.56,250.12, So I will make a video by scrolling like this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",250.12,251.48000000000002, I will highlight it like this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",251.48000000000002,252.52, So I don't want audio in it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",252.52,254.12, So I will mute it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",254.20000000000002,257.76, So you can use muted attribute in your websites.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",257.76,258.4, Then poster.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",258.4,259.64, Poster is very important.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",259.64,261.6, So I have an image here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",261.6,263.44, Download.jpg.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",263.44,266.08, If I write here poster is equal to
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",266.08,268.04, And I write download.jpg.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",268.04,269.96, So you will see something like this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",269.96,270.24, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",270.24,270.96, This is how it looks.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",270.96,272.44, I will play it in poster.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",272.44,273.56, So the video will be played.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",273.56,274.56, So like a thumbnail.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",274.56,274.84000000000003, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",274.84000000000003,276.36, I have seen the thumbnail of YouTube video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",276.36,278.36, This is the poster attribute.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",278.36,280.88, So you can use these attributes.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",280.88,282.88, You know that width and height
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",282.88,284.88, Specifies the dimension of the video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",284.88,286.88, Like I have seen width and height.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",286.88,289.88, So I hope you have understood this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",289.88,293.88, Now what I want to tell you after this is audio.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",293.88,295.88, So this is all the attributes of the video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",295.88,296.88, It is straight forward.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",296.88,298.88, I want you to make a website.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",298.88,301.88, Which I am going to give you at the end of this video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",301.88,302.88, In quick quiz.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",302.88,303.88, So listen to the quick quiz.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",303.88,306.88," In fact, I will put a quick quiz from the heading."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",306.88,308.88, So that I don't forget.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",308.88,309.88, I will give you this right now.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",309.88,311.88, And this is going to be a fun quiz.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",311.88,313.88, And everyone should solve this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",313.88,315.88, But before that.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",315.88,317.88," As you write audio here, SRC comes."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",317.88,319.88, And I am putting SRC in Sachin.mp3.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",319.88,321.88, So I will put it in Sachin.mp3.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",321.88,322.88, Now look here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",322.88,324.88, I will reload it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",324.88,326.88, And here audio is not here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",326.88,327.88, Which is strange.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",327.88,328.88, Let me see what is the problem here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",328.88,330.88, I will not put SRC equal to many.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",330.88,332.88, I will have to write controls here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",332.88,334.88," So if I write with controls, then I will not see audio."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",334.88,335.88," Look, now the audio is here."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",335.88,336.88, I have seen controls here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",336.88,338.88, I can set the volume of this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",338.88,339.88, So I will play this audio.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",339.88,341.88, What is Sachin in Sachin?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",341.88,342.88, It is 90 Sachin.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",342.88,343.88, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",343.88,344.88, So this is audio.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",344.88,346.88," If I mute it, then it will not work."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",346.88,347.88, And I can increase it further.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",347.88,348.88, 90 Sachin.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",348.88,349.88, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",349.88,350.88, You have seen it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",350.88,351.88, So this is Sachin.mp3.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",351.88,352.88, What is the audio?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",352.88,353.88, Now what we will do?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",353.88,355.88, We will see some attributes of this audio.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",355.88,357.88, You know from SRC that source.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",357.88,358.88, Video file.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",358.88,359.88, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",359.88,361.88," Then after this, you know controls."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",361.88,362.88," Play, pause, volume."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",362.88,363.88, Which we just saw.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",363.88,364.88, What will auto play?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",364.88,365.88, It will automatically play.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",365.88,367.88, If I play here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",367.88,368.88, What is Sachin in Sachin?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",368.88,369.88, It will automatically play.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",369.88,370.88, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",370.88,372.88, So what will auto play?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",372.88,373.88, It will automatically play.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",373.88,374.88, This is our audio.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",374.88,377.88," After this, the next attribute is loop."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",377.88,378.88, What will loop do?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",378.88,379.88, It will repeat it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",379.88,382.88," If I want to loop it, then I have played auto play."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",382.88,383.88, I will loop it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",383.88,384.88, What is Sachin in Sachin?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",384.88,386.88, It is 90 Sachin.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",386.88,387.88, Once.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",387.88,388.88, What is Sachin in Sachin?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",388.88,389.88, Once.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",389.88,390.88, So you saw it repeated.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",390.88,391.88, Means it was saved once.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",391.88,393.88, Then it was saved again.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",393.88,395.88, Because I had been looping the audio.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",395.88,396.88, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",396.88,397.88, So you saw it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",397.88,398.88, I looped Sachin.mp3.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",398.88,400.88, Means it was saved once again.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",400.88,402.88, Then it was saved again.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",402.88,403.88, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",403.88,404.88, What is Sachin?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",404.88,405.88, Sachin was repeatedly saying it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",405.88,408.88, Because this MP3 will play again and again.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",408.88,410.88, So there are many other cases.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",410.88,413.88, When you want MP3 to be repeated.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",413.88,414.88, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",414.88,417.88," So if you want your MP3 to be repeated, then you can use it."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",417.88,420.88," Now after this, what will mutate?"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",420.88,421.88, It will mute the audio.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",421.88,424.88, And definitely you don't want to mute your audio by default.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",424.88,425.88, You can mute most of the cases.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",425.88,430.88, But we sometimes want the audio to be muted.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",430.88,433.88, And we can say to the user that we have to listen to it and mute it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",433.88,434.88, What is Sachin?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",434.88,436.88, We do this when we have multiple audios.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",436.88,438.88, You want to show 5-6 audios at once.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",438.88,439.88, You can mute them.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",439.88,443.88, The user who wants to play and mute it can see it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",443.88,445.88, So you have control over it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",445.88,447.88, If you want you can use it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",447.88,448.88, Okay.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",448.88,450.88, So I hope you understood this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",450.88,452.88, You must have enjoyed it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",452.88,453.88, Now preload.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",453.88,455.88, The most confusing attribute.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",455.88,458.88, That's why I have explained it in CodeWithRail.com.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",458.88,461.88, Preload attribute can be the value of it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",461.88,462.88, The first value can be none.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",462.88,463.88, This is the default value.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",463.88,466.88, It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio at all.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",466.88,471.88," Preload means if you want to fetch the browser data first,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",471.88,473.88, then you will use preload attribute.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",473.88,476.88, Otherwise you won't use preload attribute.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",476.88,477.88, Preload is equal to none.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",477.88,478.88, It is the default value.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",478.88,480.88, Preload is equal to metadata.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",480.88,485.88, The browser will preload the audio information.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",485.88,487.88, It will preload the audio.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",487.88,491.88, It will preload the entire audio.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",491.88,493.88, Preload is equal to auto.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",493.88,496.88, It will be downloaded and automatically loaded.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",496.88,499.88," So that when the user plays, the audio is saved."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",499.88,501.88, Preload attribute works.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",501.88,503.88, It is often asked in interviews.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",503.88,504.88, Preload attribute.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",504.88,506.88, You should know what preload attribute is.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",506.88,510.88," Before moving on, I want you to share this playlist with your friends."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",510.88,512.88, I am seeing that the interest is declining.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",512.88,514.88, As we are moving forward in the videos.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",514.88,517.88, I request you to like this video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",517.88,521.88," And as you are doing this repository,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",521.88,523.88, you should also start it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",523.88,527.88, Your likes and your star will help me in bringing such free courses.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",527.88,530.88, So this was about audio and video tags.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",530.88,532.88, I have also told you all the attributes.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",532.88,534.88, You should definitely use this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",534.88,538.88, I will give you all the images so that you can try out this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",538.88,542.88, Many people were asking if we can use the replete.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",542.88,544.88, I have not used the replete in this course.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",544.88,546.88, But replete.com is an amazing website.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",546.88,549.88," If you want to use it in your phone,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",549.88,551.88," HTML, if you want to run it,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",551.88,554.88, It is also a replete app for iOS and Android.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",554.88,555.88, So you can try it out.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",555.88,558.88, Many people are asking how to record in your phone.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",558.88,560.88, But I want to use the VS Code.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",560.88,564.88, Most of the people prefer to use it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",564.88,566.88, So I thought I should make videos in VS Code.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",566.88,569.88, But I personally use the replete.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",569.88,571.88," In fact, videos are also used in replete."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",571.88,573.88, The next topic is SVG.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",573.88,574.88, It is related to media.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",574.88,576.88, SVG is a format.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",576.88,579.88, So you can create images.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",579.88,582.88, It is a high graphics vector image.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",582.88,585.88, You can make circles in it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",585.88,588.88, So SVG is used in the same way.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",588.88,590.88, The way it is used.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",590.88,592.88, Look at our IMG tab.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",592.88,594.88," If I put SVG here,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",594.88,595.88, Then this SVG will come here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",595.88,597.88," See, this circle and SVG came here."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",597.88,600.88," Video, audio, SVG were these line elements."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",600.88,603.88, So we are getting to see them in the line.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",603.88,604.88, You have seen here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",604.88,606.88, Now what is here?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",606.88,608.88, You can save SVG file separately.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",608.88,610.88, You can save SVG file separately.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",610.88,612.88, If I write here that
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",612.88,616.88, I am G dot SVG and save SVG content.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",616.88,618.88, If I write here that I am G
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",618.88,622.88, And I am G dot SVG.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",622.88,624.88, So you can see here that
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",624.88,625.88, I didn't get to see this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",625.88,627.88, If I write here all.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",627.88,629.88, And write my SVG image.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",629.88,631.88, So you can see here that
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",631.88,632.88, My SVG image came like this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",632.88,634.88, But I didn't get to see SVG.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",634.88,635.88, Why did this happen?
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",635.88,637.88, It happened because SVG is
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",637.88,641.88, SVG file in browser.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",641.88,645.88," And when you see SVG file in browser,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",645.88,647.88, You will put a declaration.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",647.88,648.88, I will show you.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",648.88,651.88, So I wrote SVG file not showing.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",651.88,654.88, So here is the answer of stack overflow.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",654.88,656.88, So you have to write this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",656.88,657.88, I will show you.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",657.88,659.88," XML, something like this."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",659.88,661.88, You have to add this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",661.88,663.88, It is called name space declaration.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",663.88,666.88, So you have to add this thing.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",666.88,668.88," And now you see here,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",668.88,670.88, This is very important.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",670.88,673.88," When you make websites in future,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",673.88,675.88, You will get into this problem.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",675.88,676.88, I will keep getting into it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",676.88,677.88, So I am telling you.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",677.88,679.88," The problem you got into,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",679.88,680.88, I told you earlier.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",680.88,681.88, You didn't get any problem.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",681.88,683.88, I told you about problem and solution.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",683.88,685.88, Next topic is iframes.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",685.88,687.88, Iframes is very simple.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",687.88,691.88, You can embed your website from iframes.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",691.88,694.88," Like if I want to embed this web page,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",694.88,697.88, I can use iframes like this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",697.88,699.88, So I wrote iframe here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",699.88,701.88, I will copy this URL.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",701.88,703.88, And paste it here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",703.88,705.88," And you see here,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",705.88,707.88, The entire website is embedded.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",707.88,708.88, In iframes.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",708.88,711.88, You will definitely want to embed it in big iframes.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",711.88,713.88," But if you want it to be embedded,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",713.88,714.88, You can do it like this.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",714.88,717.88, I will increase the height of it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",717.88,719.88, Width is equal to width.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",719.88,721.88, Width is equal to 122.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",721.88,723.88, Height is equal to 444.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",723.88,726.88, So this is how it came.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",726.88,728.88, Now definitely you were coming in this width.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",728.88,730.88, So it came in this line.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",730.88,732.88, But I will increase the width.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",732.88,734.88, I will increase the width.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",734.88,735.88, 322.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",735.88,736.88," So see here,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",736.88,738.88, The entire website is embedded.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",738.88,739.88, You can see here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",739.88,741.88, You can embed a website.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",741.88,743.88, Another use of iframe is YouTube video.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",743.88,745.88," If you want to share YouTube video,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",745.88,747.88, Click on embed.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",747.88,749.88, It will give you iframe code.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",749.88,751.88, You can start it any way.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",751.88,753.88," If you want to start at a particular time,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",753.88,755.88, You can do it here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",755.88,757.88," If you start at a particular point,"
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",757.88,759.88, You will share it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",759.88,761.88, I will show you.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",761.88,763.88, I want you to start from here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",763.88,765.88, Start from here.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",765.88,767.88, I will click on share.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",767.88,769.88," After clicking on share, I will click on embed."
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",769.88,771.88, I will start at 1219.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",771.88,773.88, I will copy it.
10,"Video, Audio & Media in HTML",773.88,775.88, I will put it in my code.

11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,97.60000000000001,102.80000000000001," And they will rank our website on Google, Bing, and on respective search engines."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,102.80000000000001,105.80000000000001, And we want that the crawlers understand our website.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,105.80000000000001,109.80000000000001," And we want that whatever our website wants to understand, they can understand it properly."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,109.8,115.2," That is why there are some special tags like header, nav, main, article, figure."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,115.2,121.39999999999999, All these special tags are made in HTML which helps you to structure your website.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,121.39999999999999,125.39999999999999," Now if there is anything in the header, then I know that this is the header, that is at the top."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,125.39999999999999,129.4," If there is anything in the footer, then I will understand that the website has started ending from here."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,129.4,130.8, This footer started here.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,130.8,132.8," This footer could have been a div too, but no."

11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,137.4,142.4," And along with that, I was making my navigation bar in the span tag."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,142.4,145.4, This time I will not make my navigation bar in the span tag.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,145.4,148.4, I will make my navigation bar in the nav tag.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,148.4,154.4, So these kinds of differences make our search engines understand our website well.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,154.4,159.4, So I will show you some examples of Semantic tags here.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,159.4,162.4, And I hope you understood what Semantic tags are.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,162.4,164.4, Now look at the downloaded folders of our computer.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,164.4,169.4, Some of you might have noticed that the download folder of the world is in the same folder.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,169.4,174.4, 90% of your computer files are downloaded folders of many people.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,174.4,175.4, But we should not do that.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,175.4,182.4," Some people go through this to the limit that they start sending files in their local disc, in Windows folder."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,182.4,186.4, And some people also keep files in System32.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,186.4,193.4," So if you send your files to your computer, then it will not be arranged in one way."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,193.4,199.4," But if you arrange your files in folders, then it is in one folder."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,199.4,203.4," If you want to keep a secret file in a folder, then you can put it in a secret file."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,203.4,209.4," If you want to make a folder, then you can put some files in it."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,209.4,211.4, So it will be arranged in one way.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,211.4,214.4," You have arranged images in one way, you have arranged videos in one way,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,214.4,217.4, and you have arranged ebooks in one way.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,217.4,219.4," So whenever you go to search, you will get it."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,219.4,227.4," So to understand that, it will be better to use that folder structure instead of sending your files throughout the computer."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,227.4,231.4, You will definitely not want to send your files throughout the computer.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,231.4,235.4, So I hope you understand why we use Semantic Tags.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,235.4,237.4, This is very good for SEO.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,237.4,239.4, So I have not used SEO word yet.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,239.4,245.4, But SEO search engine optimization is a very important part of using Semantic Tags.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,245.4,246.4, So what happens?
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,246.4,251.4," Basically, the way you make your website, you just use some special tags."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,251.4,253.4," For example, let's say I am making this website."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,253.4,257.4, I will comment out this image here.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,257.4,259.4, I will not comment out this image.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,259.4,262.4, I will make a nav here.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,262.4,265.4," So what I will do is, first of all, I will say that this is the header of my website."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,265.4,266.4, I have used it in a header tag.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,266.4,268.4, I will make a nav in it.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,268.4,270.4, I will make an unordered list in it.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,270.4,272.4, I will make an ally in it.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,272.4,274.4, I will write home here.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,274.4,276.4, I am writing a lot of letters in it.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,276.4,279.4, And this is my header.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,279.4,282.4, So any of my website pack will understand that this is my header.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,282.4,286.4," Home, about, contact, whatever I want to write, I can write here."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,286.4,288.4, So this is my header.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,288.4,289.4, This is my nav bar.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,289.4,292.4, This is clearly known because I have used header and nav tags.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,292.4,294.4, So I write about here.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,294.4,296.4, And I write contact here.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,296.4,299.4," So I wrote home here, wrote about here and wrote contact here."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,299.4,302.4, So I hope you understand this.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,302.4,305.4," Now if I want to make a footer, I want to make a footer."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,305.4,307.4, Here my main content will come after the header.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,307.4,309.4, So I will use the main tag.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,309.4,313.4," And after that, I will write in my footer."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,313.4,315.4, Copyright CWH
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,315.4,320.4, And here I will write All rights reserved.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,320.4,322.4, I can write like this.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,322.4,325.4," So here, see copyright, All rights reserved."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,325.4,326.4, I have written all this here.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,326.4,330.4," So I will do this, I will cut this."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,330.4,331.4, I will put it in the main.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,331.4,332.4, This is my main content.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,332.4,335.4," So first my header will come, then the main content will come, then the footer will come."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,335.4,336.4, As you can see here.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,336.4,338.4, And here you can see here this is the header.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,338.4,340.4," This is my main content, this is the footer."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,340.4,342.4," So in one way, I arranged it."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,342.4,345.4," In a way, you arrange your files in different folders."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,345.4,348.4, I arranged my HTML tags here.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,348.4,353.4, So we understood about the header tag that it is used to represent the top section of a web page.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,353.4,354.4, The header is there.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,354.4,357.4," Then after that, we will put nav, which is navigation menu on our page."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,357.4,359.4, We will put that in the nav tag ideally.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,359.4,364.4, Article indicates a self-containing piece of content such as blog post or news article.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,364.4,369.4," If you put a particular self-contained piece of content, then put it in the article tag."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,369.4,372.4, Section represents a thematic grouping.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,372.4,377.4," Suppose, one section is talking about something on your page, then the other section will talk about something else."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,377.4,381.4," Aside, aside means if anything is on one side, then they use aside tag."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,381.4,387.4," Here, see typically used for sidebars or content that is tangentially related to the main content."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,387.4,392.4," For example, what you can do on this aside tag is that you have to put a side note about the author."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,392.4,395.4, I have seen many blogs where it is written on the side about the author.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,395.4,397.4, You can put such things as aside tags.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,397.4,399.4," Then after this, we have the footer tag."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,399.4,401.4, I have told you about it.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,401.4,403.4," Copyright information, if you want to put all these things."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,403.4,408.4," Or if you want to put some important links on the website, then you can put them in the footer."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,408.4,410.4," Then after this, figure and pick caption."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,410.4,412.4, What is figure and pick caption?
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,412.4,416.4," You can also use images, diagrams, charts, all these things."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,416.4,423.4," The main content area in the main content area, like the main content area of our speech, is that we put it in the main tag."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,423.4,427.4," Then there is the time tag, used to represent time related information."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,427.4,431.4," You can use the time tag, you can put date, time or anything."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,431.4,434.4," So, I hope you have understood this."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,434.4,440.4," So, these are used to enhance SEO, to improve accessibility."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,440.4,444.4," If you want to take a decision about a browser, let's say there is a browser,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,444.4,448.4," and it has a new feature, it will read our content aloud."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,448.4,450.4, Like the feature is on the edge.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,450.4,453.4," So, the browser can decide that I am reading the main content."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,453.4,456.4, Think about how to read the content aloud.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,456.4,459.4," Code with Harry, Home, Code, Cis, Tutorial."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,459.4,461.4, You don't want to read aloud like this.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,461.4,465.4," You want the main content to be read, like HTML, Semantic Tags."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,465.4,468.4," HTML5 Introduce, Range of Semantic Tags and so on."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,468.4,472.4," The first versions of our HTML, were not Semantic Tags."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,472.4,475.4, Semantic Tags were introduced by HTML5.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,475.4,481.4, And the most important reason to introduce Semantic Tags in HTML5 is to arrange things.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,481.4,485.4," So that the browsers, or the content that is parsing,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,485.4,491.4," who are watching the content, like browser, crawler, Google, Bing, search engines,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,491.4,494.4," or anyone who wants to generate preview, like you put URL on Twitter,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,494.4,498.4," or you want to generate preview, if you have such things,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,498.4,502.4, then you will want to be able to understand your content well.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,502.4,505.4," So, if you want to understand your content well,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,505.4,507.4, then you will use Semantic Tags.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,507.4,511.4," Or this image is very good, it is explaining that without Semantic Tags,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,511.4,514.4," if you write like this in HTML, then you will write like this."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,514.4,518.4," The image you see, this header, this nav, this side,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,518.4,522.4," how to put something in the side, we will do it with CSS."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,522.4,525.4," Don't get confused, this is not used for styling,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,525.4,527.4," because a lot of people are confused, that is not the case,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,527.4,531.4," that aside tag, it is used to do things, no, it is not like that."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,531.4,534.4," You will have to style the things with CSS only,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,534.4,538.4," but here, your content can be understood well,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,538.4,541.4," described well, which main content, which header, which foot,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,541.4,543.4, that is why Semantic Tags are made.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,543.4,545.4," So, Semantic Tags are not made by any magic,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,545.4,547.4," Semantic Tags are made only for accessibility,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,547.4,549.4, and to understand your page.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,549.4,551.4," Now, here are some examples, which you can see."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,551.4,554.4," I have given the example of header and foot attack here,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,554.4,556.4," what will happen in the header,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,556.4,559.4," or you see that you will put your navigation bar ideally in the header,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,559.4,561.4, and then you will style it with CSS.
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,561.4,564.4," I will show you a very quick styling,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,564.4,566.4," obviously, we will do it later after styling,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,566.4,568.4," but a lot of people will be confused,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,568.4,570.4, how will this navigation bar be horizontal?
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,570.4,572.4," So, if you want to horizontalize the navigation bar,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,572.4,574.4," then I will write some CSS here,"
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,574.4,577.4," and I will tell you all this, why CSS works here."
11,Semantic Tags  in HTML,577.4,579.4," So, you see, I flexed the display,"

12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,70.0,72.0, And I will give you a question.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,72.0,74.0," So the question is,"
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,74.0,80.0, you are given 12 video files.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,80.0,84.0," 12 files, 6 audio and 6 video."
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,84.0,86.0, And 6 video.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,86.0,91.0, Design a website using HTML only.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,91.0,96.0, And which shows these 12 files.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,96.0,99.0," Okay, I will do a little toggle word wrap here."
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,99.0,102.0, So that you can see the word wrap.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,102.0,104.0, So what you have to do is that you are given 12 files.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,104.0,106.0, And what is the name of those files?
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,106.0,108.0," 1.mp3, 2.mp3."
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,108.0,111.0, So I will tell you what is the name of those files?
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,111.0,113.0," 1.mp3, 2.mp3."
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,113.0,116.0, All the way till 6.mp3.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,116.0,117.0, So these are your files.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,117.0,121.0," Then you have 1.mp4, 2.mp4."
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,121.0,124.0, All the way till 6.mp4.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,124.0,126.0," Okay, these are your files."
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,126.0,128.0," So all these files, which are 12 files,"
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,128.0,130.0, you have to show by preview.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,130.0,132.0, So I hope this will be done.

12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,176.0,178.0, That you can comment or uncomment.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,178.0,180.0," So if you press control forward slash,"
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,180.0,181.0, then it will be uncommented.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,181.0,183.0," And if you press control forward slash again,"
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,183.0,185.0, then it will be commented.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,185.0,187.0, So you have to complete this website.
12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,187.0,188.0, It is a very simple problem.

12,Exercise 1 - Pure HTML Media Player,199.0,221.0, Music
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",0.0,2.6," Guys, we have seen almost everything in HTML."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",2.6,7.48," In today's video, we will talk about some miscellaneous things that we have been doing."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",7.48,10.040000000000001, Which will help you a lot in your web development journey.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",10.040000000000001,12.48," After that, we will start CSS from the upcoming videos."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",12.48,14.72, I am very excited to be doing the content of HTML.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",14.72,18.92, Do like this video and write a sigma patch in the comment section below.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",18.92,20.28, Let's go to the computer screen.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",20.28,21.68, Let's roll the intro.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",30.64,33.48," As you can see, I have entered my computer screen."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",33.48,36.12, I will make a new folder without wasting time.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",36.12,37.76, The name of the folder is Video13.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",37.76,40.68, I will come in and click on Shift and open the VS Code.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",40.68,42.76, And I will make a file.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",42.76,45.04, Index.html.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",45.04,48.96, Now I have given the file to Index.html.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",48.96,50.760000000000005, Now I want to tell you something.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",50.760000000000005,55.2, There are many things in HTML that you have to explore.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",55.2,59.2, I will tell you some things and then I will conclude the HTML.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",59.28,61.36," If you want to write in HTML,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",61.36,65.2, I will open the word wrap and toggle the screencast mode.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",65.2,67.36," If you want to write in HTML,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",67.36,69.04, 3 is greater than 4.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",69.04,72.56," If you want to write in HTML,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",72.56,74.08, I will show you the preview.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",74.08,76.4," So, 3 is greater than 4."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",76.4,81.16," Now, I will write in the code for paragraph."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",81.16,83.96000000000001, And I will write something like this.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",83.96000000000001,85.68, I have written this.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",85.68,88.16, I want it to appear.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",88.32,90.84," But you see, it will not appear."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",90.84,91.8, Why not?
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",91.8,94.52, Because how will it know that I want to write the code for paragraph?
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",94.52,97.8, Or I want to use the syntax of the PTAG?
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",97.8,100.75999999999999," So, HTML entities are to be saved from this."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",100.75999999999999,102.32," Now, what are the HTML entities?"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",102.32,103.16, I will tell you.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",103.16,104.12," If you write here,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",104.12,106.08," ampersandltsemi column,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",106.08,107.4," LT for less than,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",107.4,110.24, then you can write it as LTsemi column.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",110.24,111.4," Now, if you write here,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",111.4,113.67999999999999," ampersandltsemi column,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",113.67999999999999,116.6, and replace it with ampersandltsemi column.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",116.6,118.08," And the greater than one is simple,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",118.08,120.47999999999999, you replace it with ampersandltsemi column.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",120.47999999999999,122.47999999999999, I will show you by doing this.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",122.47999999999999,126.03999999999999," If you replace it with ampersandltsemi column,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",126.03999999999999,127.24, then what will happen?
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",127.24,131.4, That it will appear here as it is written here.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",131.4,132.4, As you can see here.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",132.4,133.79999999999998, I will zoom it here.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",133.79999999999998,135.07999999999998," So, what happens?"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",135.07999999999998,137.88, That HTML entities are used.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",137.88,138.95999999999998," To write those things,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",138.95999999999998,141.88, which should be collided with the syntax of HTML.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",141.88,143.28, What will be collided?
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",143.28,146.4," That if we write the code for paragraph,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",146.4,149.08, how will we know if it is the code for paragraph tag?
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",149.08,151.72," Or actually, you want to write this thing as it is."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",151.72,153.28, There is a pre-tag for this.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",153.28,155.08," If you put anything in pre-tag,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",155.08,156.12," and you write here,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",156.12,158.96," then P, this is a paragraph."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",158.96,160.88," So, if you write it like this,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",160.88,162.4, then it will appear as it is here.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",162.4,164.0, As you can see.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",164.0,165.6, It will appear as it is.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",165.6,167.20000000000002," And along with that,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",167.20000000000002,168.88," if you write new lines here,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",168.88,172.48000000000002, this is after few new lines.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",172.48000000000002,174.6, Okay. And some more.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",174.6,175.8," If you write like this,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",175.8,177.4," then as it is,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",177.4,178.96, it will keep all the spaces intact.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",178.96,180.84, It keeps all the new lines intact.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",180.84,182.76000000000002," But here, it will not show up as a tag."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",182.76000000000002,185.12, We will have to use the entities for tags.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",185.12,187.12," So, this happens in pre-tag HTML."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",187.12,188.28," So, we have seen entities."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",188.28,189.4, We have seen pre-tag.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",189.4,191.04000000000002," If you want to put a copyright symbol,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",191.04000000000002,194.20000000000002, then you can write Ampercent Copy Semicolon.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",194.20000000000002,196.72000000000003," And as you write Ampercent Copy Semicolon,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",196.72000000000003,198.76000000000002, then you will get to see the copyright symbol here.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",198.76000000000002,200.32000000000002, As you can see.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",200.32000000000002,203.16000000000003," So, you can do these things with the help of HTML entities."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",203.16000000000003,205.0," So, you have to try out all these examples."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",205.0,206.6, You can use non-breaking spaces.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",206.6,208.72," Along with that, you can use special symbols."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",208.72,210.12, Like the copyright we saw.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",210.12,213.48, Ampercent NBSP is used for space.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",213.48,214.8, And it is very important.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",214.8,217.32," So, if I write Copyright here."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",217.32,219.12, Okay. I will write Copyright here.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",220.32,223.4, And I want to see many spaces here for some reason.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",223.4,225.04, And I will write Code With Harry.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",225.04,225.56, Okay.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",225.56,227.32," So, if I write Copyright Code With Harry,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",227.32,228.96, then this space will be considered as fake space.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",228.96,232.08, Because the extra spaces in HTML are ignored.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",232.08,232.92000000000002," So, if you see here,"
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",232.92,235.88, then the code was ignored right after the copyright.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",235.88,237.88," But ideally, we won't want this."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",237.88,238.88, What do we want?
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",238.88,241.6," We want these spaces that I have put in, to come."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",241.6,242.72," So, don't put in spaces."
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",242.72,244.72, You put in Ampercent NBSP.
13,"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML",244.72,246.83999999999997, You will put Ampercent NBSP as many times as you want.

14,Introduction to CSS,263.08000000000004,265.08000000000004, There are two other ways.
14,Introduction to CSS,265.08000000000004,267.08000000000004, I'll tell you in the upcoming videos.
14,Introduction to CSS,267.08000000000004,268.08000000000004, I'll tell you a lot of things.
14,Introduction to CSS,268.08000000000004,270.08000000000004," Now, if I say,"
14,Introduction to CSS,270.08000000000004,272.08000000000004," look, the div is,"
14,Introduction to CSS,272.08000000000004,274.08000000000004," the div is,"
14,Introduction to CSS,274.08000000000004,276.08000000000004, color it red.
14,Introduction to CSS,276.08000000000004,277.08000000000004, I'll say this.
14,Introduction to CSS,277.08000000000004,280.08000000000004," I said, color the div red."
14,Introduction to CSS,280.08000000000004,282.08000000000004," So, in this div,"
14,Introduction to CSS,282.08,283.08, what is this?
14,Introduction to CSS,283.08,284.08, This is the selector.
14,Introduction to CSS,284.08,285.08, And this is our declaration.
14,Introduction to CSS,285.08,287.08," So, selector and declaration."
14,Introduction to CSS,287.08,288.08, What is selector?
14,Introduction to CSS,288.08,289.08, It is the div.
14,Introduction to CSS,289.08,290.08," That is, all the divs of this page."
14,Introduction to CSS,290.08,291.08, Color it.
14,Introduction to CSS,291.08,293.08, Which is our key.
14,Introduction to CSS,293.08,294.08, This is our property.
14,Introduction to CSS,294.08,296.08, This is the value of that property.
14,Introduction to CSS,296.08,297.08, Red the color.
14,Introduction to CSS,297.08,299.08," Okay, so this is our declaration."
14,Introduction to CSS,299.08,301.08, And this is our selector.
14,Introduction to CSS,301.08,303.08, I hope you understood.
14,Introduction to CSS,303.08,305.08," So, here, I'll show you the page."
14,Introduction to CSS,305.08,306.08," See, its color is red."
14,Introduction to CSS,306.08,308.08," Because I said, whatever is the div in this page,"
14,Introduction to CSS,308.08,309.08, color it red.
14,Introduction to CSS,309.08,311.08," Okay, so if I make another div here,"
14,Introduction to CSS,311.08,313.08," and write, I am good,"
14,Introduction to CSS,313.08,315.08, then that I am good color will be ready.
14,Introduction to CSS,315.08,316.08, As you can see.
14,Introduction to CSS,316.08,319.08, And if I add another declaration in this.
14,Introduction to CSS,319.08,321.08," And I write, background yellow."
14,Introduction to CSS,321.08,323.08," So, here, its background is yellow."
14,Introduction to CSS,323.08,325.08, Its background is also yellow.
14,Introduction to CSS,325.08,327.08," Whatever matches this selector,"
14,Introduction to CSS,327.08,329.08, that element's background will be yellow.
14,Introduction to CSS,329.08,331.08," Like you see here, I said, div."
14,Introduction to CSS,331.08,333.08," And here, this was the div."
14,Introduction to CSS,333.08,335.08," And here, this was the div."
14,Introduction to CSS,335.08,337.08," If I make a span here,"
14,Introduction to CSS,337.08,339.08," and I write, I am also good."
14,Introduction to CSS,339.08,341.08," Okay, so what will happen?"
14,Introduction to CSS,341.08,343.08, Will this also be red?
14,Introduction to CSS,343.08,345.08," No, its color will not be red."
14,Introduction to CSS,345.08,347.08," Because this selector,"
14,Introduction to CSS,347.08,349.08, and these declarations
14,Introduction to CSS,349.08,351.08, are not applicable on these elements.
14,Introduction to CSS,351.08,353.08," Okay, any element which is not div."
14,Introduction to CSS,353.08,355.08," Okay, if I add a paragraph here."
14,Introduction to CSS,355.08,357.08," And here, add Lorem 435."
14,Introduction to CSS,357.08,359.08," Oops, I think 435 is too much."
14,Introduction to CSS,359.08,361.08, 43 is enough.
14,Introduction to CSS,361.08,363.08," Okay, so here, I have added a very big Lorem."
14,Introduction to CSS,363.08,365.08, Which will make our page very big.
14,Introduction to CSS,365.08,367.08," In this, the declaration that we have made,"
14,Introduction to CSS,367.08,371.08," in this, this declaration was not applicable."
14,Introduction to CSS,371.08,373.08, It was not applicable in this too.
14,Introduction to CSS,373.08,375.08, I had only said div.
14,Introduction to CSS,375.08,377.08," So, all these conditions"
14,Introduction to CSS,377.08,379.08, have been applied in div.
14,Introduction to CSS,379.08,381.08," Now, by adding comma here,"
14,Introduction to CSS,381.08,383.08, I can select multiple elements.
14,Introduction to CSS,383.08,385.08," I can say, do this in divorce pan."
14,Introduction to CSS,385.08,387.08," So, divorce pan will be red in both."
14,Introduction to CSS,387.08,389.08," And here, background color will be yellow."
14,Introduction to CSS,389.08,391.08, Divorce pan is my selector.
14,Introduction to CSS,391.08,393.08," So, I have applied these declarations"
14,Introduction to CSS,393.08,395.08, in multiple selectors.
14,Introduction to CSS,395.08,397.08," Here, property, background color is a property."
14,Introduction to CSS,397.08,399.08, Its value is yellow.
14,Introduction to CSS,399.08,401.08, Color is a property whose value is red.
14,Introduction to CSS,401.08,403.08," Okay, here you can see,"
14,Introduction to CSS,403.08,405.08," wherever it will be div,"
14,Introduction to CSS,405.08,407.08," wherever it will be span,"
14,Introduction to CSS,407.08,409.08, this thing will be lagged.
14,Introduction to CSS,409.08,411.08, And that's pretty much how CSS works.
14,Introduction to CSS,411.08,413.08, That's it.
14,Introduction to CSS,413.08,415.08," What we will learn in the coming videos,"
14,Introduction to CSS,415.08,417.08, that this is from property
14,Introduction to CSS,417.08,419.08, and this is from selector.
14,Introduction to CSS,419.08,421.08, I will tell you about selectors in different ways.
14,Introduction to CSS,421.08,423.08, That's about it.
14,Introduction to CSS,423.08,425.08, As simple as that.
14,Introduction to CSS,425.08,427.08," And by using these selectors,"
14,Introduction to CSS,427.08,429.08," we can make a website like Amazon,"
14,Introduction to CSS,429.08,431.08," Flipkart, Facebook,"
14,Introduction to CSS,431.08,433.08, and Instagram.
14,Introduction to CSS,433.08,435.08, We can make all these.
14,Introduction to CSS,435.08,437.08," And nowadays, there are such technologies in the market,"
14,Introduction to CSS,437.08,439.08, which you can
14,Introduction to CSS,439.08,441.08, code like this and make mobile apps.

15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",109.0,111.0, I will click on view and do the toggle word.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",111.0,114.0, I will do shift right click and go to command palette.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",114.0,116.0, I will toggle the screencast mode.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",116.0,118.0, Listen to me carefully.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",118.0,123.0," If I want to style this, then there is a very shortcut."
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",123.0,127.0, I call it a very quick and dirty way.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",127.0,129.0, I have a style tag.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",129.0,131.0," First, let's preview it."
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",131.0,133.0, This is how it looks.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",133.0,135.0, I have zoomed in to show you.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",135.0,137.0, The background is yellow.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",137.0,139.0, I want to red the background.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",139.0,141.0, For some weird reason.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",141.0,143.0, Let's do it.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",143.0,145.0, I have a quick and dirty way.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",145.0,147.0, I will add a style attribute.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",147.0,151.0, I will write color and yellow.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",151.0,153.0, I am helping the VSCode.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",153.0,155.0, I am writing the entire thing.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",155.0,157.0, I am completing the auto.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",157.0,159.0, That is one of the things.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",159.0,161.0, I am writing the entire thing.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",161.0,163.0, I am writing the entire thing.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",163.0,165.0, I am completing the auto.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",165.0,167.0, That is one of the reasons we are using VSCode.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",167.0,169.0," If you are in the replet or any id,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",169.0,171.0, you get this kind of support.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",171.0,173.0, The reason is that we don't do coding in the notepad.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",173.0,177.0," At the beginning, people asked me why we don't do it in the notepad."
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",177.0,179.0, Why do we do it in this?
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",179.0,183.0, I want to add another property in Amal.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",183.0,185.0, Let me show you that this property is applied.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",185.0,187.0, Look at the color.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",187.0,189.0, I want to red the background.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",189.0,191.0, The background color is red.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",191.0,193.0, The background will also be red.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",193.0,197.0, I can do whatever I want to do with CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",197.0,201.0, I want to add things in individual elements.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",201.0,205.0, This is not considered a good practice.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",205.0,207.0, It is not considered a good practice.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",207.0,209.0, I will tell you why it is not considered.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",209.0,211.0, I will tell you two more ways.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",211.0,215.0, To add CSS to a web page.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",215.0,219.0, Let me write the title of the page.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",219.0,223.0, Three ways to add CSS to HTML.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",223.0,225.0," The first method is,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",225.0,229.0, I will use div and I will use an ordered list.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",229.0,233.0, I will write an list item.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",233.0,237.0, The first method is inline CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",237.0,239.0, I have told you about inline CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",239.0,245.0, Inline CSS is to hold any element and write in style attribute.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",245.0,249.0, The CSS will be applied in the element.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",249.0,253.0, This is the first method.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",253.0,255.0, I will tell you the second method.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",255.0,257.0, I will write inline CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",257.0,261.0, The second method is internal CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",261.0,263.0, Don't do it like this.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",263.0,265.0, I will replicate this.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",265.0,267.0, I will remove the style attribute.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",267.0,269.0, Don't do it like this.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",269.0,271.0, Write a style tag.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",271.0,273.0, Listen to me carefully.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",273.0,275.0, Listen to me carefully.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",275.0,279.0, Write a style tag in the title.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",279.0,283.0, Write your selector and declaration.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",283.0,285.0, The selector is H1.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",285.0,287.0, I have told you all H1's.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",287.0,289.0, What to do?
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",289.0,291.0, background it yellow.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",291.0,295.0, and color it red.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",295.0,297.0, I think I did color yellow.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",297.0,299.0, I will color yellow and background it red.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",299.0,303.0, I will color yellow and background it red.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",303.0,307.0, I did color yellow and background it red.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",307.0,311.0, But how is this different from inline CSS?
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",311.0,315.0, Inline CSS I have to add style on every element.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",315.0,319.0," If I have 100 H1 on my page, I can do it automatically."
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",319.0,327.0, But I have to do style is equal to in every element.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",327.0,329.0, I have to do it again and again.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",329.0,331.0, I have done it again and again.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",331.0,333.0, I have added style is equal to in every element.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",333.0,335.0, Now I have to change it.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",335.0,337.0, For some reason my boss told me that
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",337.0,339.0," in our production website,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",339.0,341.0, background color is not red.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",341.0,343.0, background color is maroon.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",343.0,347.0, I will do all the elements in one sub.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",347.0,349.0, I will do it in bulk.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",349.0,355.0, If I am using internal CSS and not inline CSS
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",355.0,357.0, then I can do it in bulk.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",357.0,359.0, I have to do maroon in one place.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",359.0,363.0, And all H1s on my page will be maroon.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",363.0,365.0, But if I have written in every element
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",365.0,367.0, style is equal to style is equal to style is equal to
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",367.0,369.0, style is equal to
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",369.0,371.0, I will have to find all the elements.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",371.0,373.0, After that I will have to do it individually.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",373.0,377.0, That is why inline CSS is not used that much.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",377.0,381.0, But inline CSS you should know
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",381.0,383.0, how to use it.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",383.0,389.0, You can do it in the internal or external CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",389.0,391.0, I will tell you about that.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",391.0,393.0, The idea of external CSS is that
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",393.0,395.0, if you are writing internal CSS
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",395.0,397.0, then your style tag will grow.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",397.0,399.0, Suppose I am writing CSS here.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",399.0,403.0, Your HTML file will grow.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",403.0,407.0, The CSS that we are writing here
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",407.0,411.0, why not write CSS in a file?
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",411.0,413.0, This is the idea of external CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",413.0,415.0, If you are writing whatever you are writing here
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",415.0,417.0, then you should not write here.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",417.0,419.0, You should write in a file.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",419.0,421.0, We will use a link tag.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",421.0,423.0, If I write in a column of CSS
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",423.0,425.0, then this shortcut will come here.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",425.0,429.0, I am saying that I have written my CSS in style.css.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",429.0,431.0, What I am doing?
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",431.0,433.0, I have written my CSS in style.css.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",433.0,435.0, Go there and see.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",435.0,437.0, I have done something like this.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",437.0,441.0, I will show you how to write style.css.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",441.0,443.0, I will write style.css here.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",443.0,445.0, I will put the styles in it.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",445.0,447.0, I will show you that the styles are gone.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",447.0,449.0," By the way, there is no background red."
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",449.0,451.0, There is no yellow.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",451.0,455.0, I will add this style.css here.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",455.0,457.0, The link tag is
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",457.0,459.0," as a style sheet,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",459.0,461.0, link style.css.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",461.0,463.0, What will happen?
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",463.0,465.0, This CSS will add to my page.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",465.0,467.0, This is the simple as that.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",467.0,469.0, I hope you have understood this.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",469.0,471.0, You have understood this very clearly.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",471.0,473.0, Inline CSS
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",473.0,475.0, Internal CSS
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",475.0,477.0, and External CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",477.0,481.0, Now I will tell you when you should use which one.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",481.0,485.0, Inline CSS you should not use it.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",485.0,489.0, I am saying that you should not use it in ideal scenarios.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",489.0,493.0," But if inline CSS is automatically generated,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",493.0,495.0, I will tell you about it later.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",495.0,497.0," Now as a beginner,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",497.0,499.0, you should understand that
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",499.0,501.0, you should at least use this line CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",501.0,503.0," In fact, you have to avoid it."
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",503.0,505.0, Internal CSS
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",505.0,507.0, you will use when your web page is very small.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",507.0,509.0, And you just have to write a little light CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",509.0,511.0, Like I told you a very good use case
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",511.0,513.0, of using internal CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",513.0,515.0," When I used to write websites in bootstrap,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",515.0,517.0," then in my website,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",517.0,519.0, I used to do all the styling in bootstrap.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",519.0,521.0, But sometimes I had to tweak it.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",521.0,523.0, I used to use internal CSS.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",523.0,525.0, External CSS
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",525.0,529.0, you will use when you are making a big production-grade website.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",529.0,531.0," And in most of the cases,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",531.0,533.0," if you are working on a serious project,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",533.0,537.0, you are making a production-grade website.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",537.0,539.0," And if you are making a production-grade website,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",539.0,543.0, you will want to use the best practices.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",543.0,545.0, And using external style sheet
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",545.0,547.0, is considered a good practice.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",547.0,549.0, Why?
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",549.0,553.0, You can detach a style sheet from an HTML.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",553.0,555.0, You can attach it.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",555.0,557.0, You can say to your colleague
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",557.0,559.0, that you work on that style sheet.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",559.0,561.0, I work on HTML.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",561.0,563.0, You write styles. I work on HTML.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",563.0,567.0," So, you can work very well."
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",567.0,569.0, Such things can be done easily
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",569.0,571.0, if you use external style sheet.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",571.0,573.0," And in most of the cases,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",573.0,575.0, you can go to any production-grade project.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",575.0,577.0, Big websites are written.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",577.0,579.0," Whether it is Netflix,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",579.0,581.0," YouTube,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",581.0,583.0," Quora,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",583.0,585.0," Facebook, Instagram,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",585.0,587.0," WhatsApp,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",587.0,589.0," In most of the cases,"
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",589.0,591.0, you will get external style sheets in all these websites.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",591.0,593.0," So, let me review you."
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",593.0,595.0, Inline CSS means
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",595.0,597.0, you have written
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",597.0,599.0, internal CSS by tagging this style in the element.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",599.0,601.0, You have written style tag.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",601.0,603.0, And external CSS means
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",603.0,605.0, you have written a style.css
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",605.0,607.0, You have made a file named
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",607.0,609.0, name.css
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",609.0,611.0, and linked a CSS file.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",611.0,613.0, I hope you have understood
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",613.0,615.0, the difference between these three.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",615.0,617.0, And I know that I am going slower
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",617.0,619.0, because there are many beginners in this course.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",619.0,621.0, I will tell you again
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",621.0,623.0, or raise the bar like anything.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",623.0,625.0, We are going to make
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",625.0,627.0, production-grade websites in future videos.
15,"Inline, Internal & External CSS",627.0,629.0," So, you will be excited."

16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,81.8,84.8," But before that, I want to solve this question"
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,84.8,88.8," So here you can see 1.mp3, 1.mp4, 2.mp3"
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,88.8,90.8, All the way till 5.mp3 is with me
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,90.8,91.8, So what I will do first
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,91.8,93.8, I will put an H1
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,93.8,95.8, My video is for the day
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,95.8,97.8," Okay, I will write H1 here"
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,97.8,99.8, And here I will write

16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,109.8,111.8, I will toggle the screencast mode
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,111.8,113.8, Because it looks a little easy
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,113.8,116.8, And here some videos
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,116.8,119.8, So I wrote H1
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,119.8,121.8, And here I put an H2
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,121.8,124.8, And here I will put videos in a dev
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,124.8,127.8, So as soon as I write the video tag
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,127.8,129.8, And after that I will write the controls
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,129.8,132.8, So I will write 1.mp4
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,132.8,134.8, And I will be able to watch it
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,134.8,136.8, What I will do is
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,136.8,138.8, I will press Shift Alt or down arrow
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,138.8,140.8, And here I will write 2
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,140.8,142.8, And here I will write 3
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,142.8,144.8, And here I will write 4
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,144.8,146.8, And then I will write 5
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,146.8,148.8, And I will do the same thing for the audio
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,148.8,150.8, And here I will write audio
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,150.8,152.8, And here I will write 1.mp3
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,152.8,154.8, And after that I will write controls
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,154.8,156.8," Okay, and after that I will do the same thing"
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,156.8,158.8, And I will replicate it 5 times
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,158.8,160.8," I did 2, I did 3, I did 4"
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,160.8,162.8, And here I will do 5
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,162.8,164.8, And obviously I will preview it
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,164.8,166.8, And I will try to show you
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,166.8,168.8, Now there is a problem here
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,168.8,170.8, And the problem is
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,170.8,172.8, It is taking the whole width of the video
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,172.8,174.8, And it is getting problematic
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,174.8,176.8, Maybe because I am zoomed in
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,176.8,178.8, So it is not getting problematic
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,178.8,180.8, Otherwise we will reset it with CSS
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,180.8,182.8, Whatever we do
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,182.8,184.8, But for now I think we are good
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,184.8,186.8, We will see in CSS how to resize it
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,186.8,188.8, How things can be improved
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,188.8,190.8, But I think our videos are here
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,190.8,192.8, And some audios for the DB are here
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,192.8,194.8, So...
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,194.8,196.8, Can you see the audios?
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,196.8,198.8, And...
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,198.8,200.8, You guys are going to sing

16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,204.8,206.8, You can see that my videos are playing
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,206.8,208.8," Hey sir, give me something to eat"
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,208.8,210.8, And...

16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,356.8,358.8, I wanted everyone to solve it
16,Exercise 1 - Solution & Shoutouts,358.8,360.8, Very few people have solved it

17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,0.0,3.0," Guys, we talked about Selectors in CSS and we said that"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,3.0,8.6, Selectors are used to select any element which is going to be applied in style.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,8.6,14.200000000000001, Now how can we apply style on elements and how can we select those elements?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,14.200000000000001,16.8," For example, Element with an ID, Element with a class."
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,16.8,19.900000000000002, We can target the element by its name.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,19.900000000000002,25.7," And we can also decide that if a particular type of element is applied in a particular type of element,"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,25.7,27.1, then it is applied in the styling.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,27.1,32.300000000000004, I will explain the rules of applying this styling in this video and explain the Selectors.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,32.300000000000004,36.0, It's fun to write a Sigma patch in the comment section.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,36.0,38.900000000000006, We have to maintain the high energy throughout the course.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,38.900000000000006,40.300000000000004, I want to give you a heads up.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,40.300000000000004,43.900000000000006, This video is a very important video of CSS.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,43.900000000000006,45.6, So increase your excitement.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,45.6,47.0, Let's go in the computer screen.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,47.0,48.5, Let's roll the intro.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,48.5,58.9, I have already added the format in the computer screen.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,58.9,62.6, The first thing I am going to do is to make the video 17 folder.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,62.6,67.4, I will call the video 17 CSS as one of the most important videos.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,67.4,72.6," Because if you understand how to selectors work, then your work will be very easy."
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,72.6,75.6, I will make the video 17 here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,75.6,77.9, I will make the index.html here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,78.30000000000001,82.80000000000001, I am going to use the internal CSS style sheet.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,82.80000000000001,86.80000000000001, So that you can see how I am doing it.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,86.80000000000001,88.80000000000001, I will do a lot of things here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,88.80000000000001,93.80000000000001," I will turn on the word wrap, turn on the screencast mode so that you can know whatever button I press."
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,93.80000000000001,97.2, I will write CSS Selectors here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,97.2,98.80000000000001, I will make a div here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,98.80000000000001,100.80000000000001, I made a div here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,100.80000000000001,102.80000000000001, I am a div here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,102.80000000000001,107.0," If you haven't accessed yet, then do the Sigma web development playlist."
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,107.1,109.1, Source code is being updated.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,109.1,112.1, So you should not be worried about that.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,112.1,115.6, Now I am going to do a simple thing.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,115.6,117.1, I will preview it first.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,117.1,119.6, I want to red the background of this div.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,119.6,123.1, Why do you want to red the background?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,123.1,127.1, Because I want to red the space of the div.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,127.1,132.1, I will give the background of the div.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,132.1,135.6, I will add a style tag to the div.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,135.7,142.7, I will say that the div is red.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,142.7,144.7, This is our property.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,144.7,146.7, This is the value.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,146.7,148.7, I will tell you about other properties and values.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,148.7,151.7, But for now you can understand that this is the property and this is the value.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,151.7,155.7, So what I did here is Element Selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,155.7,158.7, I will write Element Selector here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,158.7,160.7, I will comment on it.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,160.79999999999998,163.79999999999998," In this comment, we write forward slash star."
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,163.79999999999998,166.79999999999998," If we write star forward slash, we write comments on CSS."
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,166.79999999999998,168.79999999999998, I added a CSS comment.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,168.79999999999998,170.79999999999998, This is Element Selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,170.79999999999998,172.79999999999998, So the background is red.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,172.79999999999998,174.79999999999998, This is Element Selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,174.79999999999998,178.79999999999998," Now Element Selector, which I made here is Drop X."
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,178.79999999999998,182.79999999999998, The drop X is that I add a second div here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,182.79999999999998,184.79999999999998, So what will happen?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,184.79999999999998,186.79999999999998, This div background will be red.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,186.79999999999998,188.79999999999998, And you may want to red this div background.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,188.9,190.9," So if you don't want to red this div background,"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,190.9,192.9, then what will you do?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,192.9,194.9, Definitely you will use any other type of selector here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,194.9,196.9, And you will use any specific selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,196.9,198.9, So I can say that do one thing.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,198.9,200.9," Where the class is red, just red the div."
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,200.9,202.9, So I have red the class.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,202.9,204.9, Now because I have red the class.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,204.9,206.9, You will see here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,206.9,208.9, I will write dot red.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,208.9,210.9," After that, after redding the dot,"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,210.9,212.9, I will write dot red.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,212.9,214.9," After that, I will write dot red."
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,214.9,216.9," After that, I will write dot red."
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,217.0,219.0," After that, after redding the dot,"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,219.0,221.0," if I red the background color,"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,221.0,223.0, I will comment on it.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,223.0,225.0, I don't want the div to be red.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,225.0,227.0, So I will show you here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,227.0,229.0, This div will be red.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,229.0,231.0, As you can see here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,231.0,233.0, So that's why I used Class Selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,233.0,235.0, So this is our Class Selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,235.0,237.0, I will write here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,237.0,239.0, Class Selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,239.0,241.0, The next selector I am going to tell you is ID Selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,241.0,243.0," And as soon as you listen to ID Selector,"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,243.0,245.0, you must have guessed.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,245.1,247.1, Let us say I want the hashtag
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,247.1,249.1, red ID.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,249.1,251.1, Or let's do one thing.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,251.1,253.1, Let's make an ID with the name hashtag green.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,253.1,255.1, And if I write the background color green.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,255.1,257.1," So wherever I give the ID green,"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,257.1,259.1, it will be green.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,259.1,261.1, You can see here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,261.1,263.1, This is our I am another div.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,263.1,265.1, This is not a color.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,265.1,267.1," But as soon as I give it the ID green,"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,267.1,269.1, I will write here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,269.1,271.1, I will give this ID.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,271.1,273.1, Green.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,273.20000000000005,275.20000000000005," If I give the background color green in the ID name,"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,275.20000000000005,277.20000000000005, it will be green.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,277.20000000000005,279.20000000000005, So this is our ID Selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,279.20000000000005,281.20000000000005, It was very simple.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,281.20000000000005,283.20000000000005, It is very simple.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,283.20000000000005,285.20000000000005, Let's simplify things here.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,285.20000000000005,287.20000000000005, Now let me tell you what is Child Selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,287.20000000000005,289.20000000000005, And the source code.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,289.20000000000005,291.20000000000005, This is what will do the notes.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,291.20000000000005,293.20000000000005, So what is Child Selector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,293.20000000000005,295.20000000000005, If I want the paragraph in a div to be blue.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,295.20000000000005,297.20000000000005, If I want the paragraph in a div to be blue.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,297.20000000000005,299.20000000000005, If I want the paragraph in a div to be blue.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,299.20000000000005,301.20000000000005, If I want the paragraph in a div to be blue.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,301.38,303.38, And what is the background color.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,303.38,305.38, Let's consider the background color to be brown.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,305.38,307.38, Let's consider this.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,307.38,309.38, If I put a paragraph in any div.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,309.38,311.38, I am a para inside div.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,311.38,313.38, So what will happen.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,313.38,315.38, This selector will be lagu.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,315.38,317.38, Childselector.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,317.38,319.38, because this is the div.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,319.38,321.38, This paragraph is the div.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,321.38,323.38," And I said that if a paragraph is children,"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,323.38,325.38, then what will happen.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,325.38,327.38, Then its background color will be brown.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,327.38,329.38, And this paragraph is child.
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,329.38,332.38, Now it will be brown and blue
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,332.38,334.38," as simple as that, okay"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,334.38,336.38," Now I will show you something, if you know"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,336.38,338.38, I will wrap this in a div
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,338.38,340.38," You will understand this, actually I will not do the div"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,340.38,345.38, I will put it in the main or any other element
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,345.38,348.38, I will use the article tab here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,348.38,351.38, So now this paragraph is not in the div
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,351.38,354.38, Now this paragraph is in the article
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,354.38,356.38, So this property will not be lagoon
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,356.38,358.38," I will show you here, now this property is not lagoon"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,358.38,360.38, Because this selector means
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,360.38,362.38, that the div was directly in the div
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,362.38,364.38, Direct child
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,364.38,366.38, Then what will happen?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,366.38,368.38, This selector will be applied or not
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,368.38,370.38, This is not a direct child
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,370.38,374.38," The article is in the div, then it is not a direct child"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,374.38,376.38, But if I want
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,376.38,380.38, If the paragraph is in any div
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,380.38,382.38, Then this property will be lagoon
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,382.38,383.38, Then what will I do?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,383.38,385.38," I have another way, I will show you"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,385.38,387.38, What I will do here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,387.38,389.38, I will say
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,389.38,392.38, I will use the descendant selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,392.38,394.38, And what is the descendant selector?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,394.38,397.38, We simply write the descendant selector like this
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,397.38,400.38," I will write the div, then I will write a space"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,400.38,402.38, And then I will write p
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,402.38,404.38, I am saying that the div should be in p
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,404.38,405.38, No matter who it is
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,405.38,408.38," Whether it is in div, article, main, footer"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,408.38,410.38, It should be in the div
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,410.38,412.38," In any form, then it should be applied"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,412.38,414.38," That is, it should be a descendant of the div"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,414.38,416.38, So you see here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,416.38,418.38, That it is now lagoon property
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,418.38,420.38, But when I talk about child selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,420.38,422.38, Then it should be a child selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,422.38,423.38, Then it will be lagoon
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,423.38,425.38, I hope that you are making sense of all this
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,425.38,427.38, Now there is one more universal selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,427.38,429.38," It means, as I want"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,429.38,430.38, All the elements
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,430.38,432.38, I want to give margin to 0
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,432.38,434.38, And I want to give padding to 0
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,434.38,436.38, I will write p0
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,436.38,438.38," Through ammet, I can write padding 0"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,438.38,440.38, It means all the elements have no margin
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,440.38,441.38, No padding
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,441.38,442.38, So everyone is hiding here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,442.38,444.38," Earlier, there was margin and padding"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,444.38,445.38, Which was giving by default
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,445.38,446.38, Our Google Chrome
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,446.38,448.38, But now this margin and padding
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,448.38,449.38, Is over
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,449.38,451.38, As you have also seen
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,451.38,453.38, So I hope you have understood this
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,453.38,455.38," Now look, there are many other selectors"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,455.38,457.38, But these are the most used selectors
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,457.38,459.38, Now I will tell you more about
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,459.38,461.38, The selectors in the upcoming videos
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,461.38,462.38, But these are the ones
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,462.38,464.38, With which we will develop our web
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,464.38,466.38, So I don't want to confuse you more
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,466.38,467.38, And because of that
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,467.38,469.38, You can't learn this from the main selectors
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,469.38,471.38, So I want you to stay in mind
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,471.38,473.38, This is the most important
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,473.38,476.38," Through this, 99% of the websites are made"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,476.38,478.38, So let's focus on these
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,478.38,480.38, I hope you have understood this
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,480.38,483.38, And you understood it in a very good way
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,483.38,484.38, There is one more selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,484.38,485.38, That is also important
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,485.38,486.38, I will tell you more
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,486.38,487.38, And its name is
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,487.38,488.38, Seudo Selectors
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,488.38,490.38, Now what is Seudo selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,490.38,491.38, Suppose I want
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,491.38,492.38, I have a link
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,492.38,494.38, I will write
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,494.38,496.38, Universal selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,496.38,499.38, Universal selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,499.38,502.38, Universal selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,502.38,504.38, What is happening?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,504.38,506.38, Why is the comment not working?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,506.38,508.38, Now I will write
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,508.38,510.38, PCudo
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,510.38,512.38, PCudo
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,512.38,514.38," Yes, I know"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,514.38,515.38, It is called Seudo
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,515.38,516.38, Don't write in the comment
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,516.38,518.38, PCudo is not Seudo
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,518.38,520.38, It is Pneumonia
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,520.38,522.38, I know P is silent
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,522.38,523.38, So why did you put silent?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,523.38,525.38, Do let me know in the comment section
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,525.38,526.38, Because when it was silent
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,526.38,528.38, Then you should have left it like this
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,528.38,529.38, Tell me in the comment section
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,529.38,531.38, Which has this knowledge
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,531.38,533.38, But now I will share my knowledge with you
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,533.38,534.38, And that is
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,534.38,535.38, Seudo Selectors
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,535.38,537.38, Suppose I have a link
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,537.38,539.38, I have a link
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,539.38,540.38, The link of LIN
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,540.38,542.38, Now I will write
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,542.38,546.38, Https www.google.com
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,546.38,547.38, And I will write
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,547.38,548.38, Go to Google
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,548.38,550.38, Go to Google
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,550.38,552.38, And there is a lot of things
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,552.38,553.38, You will go to Google
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,553.38,554.38," You will say, yes, what was new in this?"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,554.38,556.38, I want its color to be
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,556.38,558.38, Let us say
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,558.38,559.38, White
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,559.38,560.38, I will not write white
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,560.38,561.38, It should be yellow
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,561.38,563.38, As soon as I visit it
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,563.38,564.38, So I want
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,564.38,566.38, What is A visited?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,566.38,568.38, A visited
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,568.38,570.38, What is its color?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,570.38,572.38, Its color should be yellow
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,572.38,574.38, So I will yellow the color
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,574.38,576.38, So will its color be yellow?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,576.38,577.38, Yes
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,577.38,578.38, So anchor text
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,578.38,581.38, If I want it to be yellow after visiting
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,581.38,583.38, Then I can use the Seudo Selectors
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,583.38,584.38, Okay
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,584.38,587.38, So here you can see its color change
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,587.38,588.38, After this
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,588.38,590.38, If you do a link
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,590.38,592.38, That is the link which is not visited
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,592.38,594.38, And suppose you want its color to be green
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,594.38,596.38, So I will put any link
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,596.38,598.38, What will be its color?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,598.38,602.38, Suppose I go to Facebook like this
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,602.38,604.38," And yes, Google's G"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,604.38,606.38, Let's do capital
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,606.38,608.38, Will its color be green?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,608.38,610.38," No, maybe I have already visited Facebook"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,610.38,612.38," Sorry, I have visited Google"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,612.38,614.38, So I will have to write Facebook here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,614.38,615.38, Okay
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,615.38,616.38, So I will write Facebook
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,616.38,617.38, Even then I will not
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,617.38,619.38, What will happen if I do Facebook 2?
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,619.38,620.38," Yes, if I do Facebook 2"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,620.38,621.38," Then look, I have not visited it"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,621.38,622.38, Facebook 2.com
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,622.38,624.38, I have actually visited Facebook 2.com
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,624.38,625.38, If you remember
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,625.38,626.38, In initial few lectures
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,626.38,628.38, So that is why I am showing it
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,628.38,629.38, Now I will tell you about two more
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,629.38,631.38, Selectors related to links
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,631.38,633.38, One is A active
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,633.38,634.38, And I will tell you
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,634.38,636.38, If you type any Seudo Selectors
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,636.38,638.38, Then you can see the emit in the suggestion
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,638.38,639.38, Now if I want
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,639.38,641.38, The background color of A active
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,641.38,643.38, So as soon as I click on any link
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,643.38,644.38, See its background color is red
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,644.38,645.38, So active means
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,645.38,646.38, When you click
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,646.38,647.38, Then
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,647.38,649.38," Okay, so here it is going to Google.com"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,649.38,650.38, And as soon as I click
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,650.38,651.38, Its background will be red
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,651.38,652.38, Okay
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,652.38,653.38, I know that ideally
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,653.38,655.38, You do not want to use background color red
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,655.38,656.38, But that was just an example
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,656.38,658.38, To show you how it happens
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,658.38,659.38, The easiest thing for me is
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,659.38,661.38, That I will red the background color
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,661.38,663.38, Because you will directly know this
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,663.38,664.38, Okay
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,664.38,666.38, Now apart from the anchor tag
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,666.38,669.38, We have some Seudo Selectors
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,669.38,670.38, The answer is yes
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,670.38,671.38, Definitely
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,671.38,672.38, One is hover
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,672.38,673.38," Okay, if I want"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,673.38,676.38, To hover on the anchor tag
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,676.38,677.38, Okay
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,677.38,678.38, And I want
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,678.38,679.38, The background color to be red
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,679.38,681.38, Here the background color to be yellow
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,681.38,683.38, If I yellow the background color
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,683.38,684.38, So if I hover
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,684.38,686.38, You can see here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,686.38,688.38, That its background color is yellow
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,688.38,689.38, As I am hovering
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,689.38,691.38, And I have written A hover
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,691.38,692.38, And the background color is yellow
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,692.38,694.38, So these were some Seudo Selectors
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,694.38,696.38, Now I will tell you one more Seudo Selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,696.38,697.38, And that would be
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,697.38,698.38, If I want
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,698.38,701.38, I have a div
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,701.38,704.38, Whose class is Selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,704.38,706.38, And I am a selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,706.38,707.38, I write
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,707.38,708.38," Okay, here I do one thing"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,708.38,709.38, I will name it one
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,709.38,711.38, You will not get confused with Selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,711.38,712.38," Oh, anyone"
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,712.38,713.38, So here I will tell you about
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,713.38,715.38, First Child Seudo Selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,715.38,716.38, Which may be a little tricky
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,716.38,717.38, You will like
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,717.38,719.38, And this is the Seudo Selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,719.38,721.38, So this Seudo Selector
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,721.38,722.38, The first child
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,722.38,723.38, If I write
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,723.38,724.38, P
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,724.38,725.38, First child's background color
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,725.38,726.38, Aqua
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,726.38,727.38, So this means
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,727.38,728.38, Wherever P is
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,728.38,730.38, The first child of your parent
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,730.38,731.38, There
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,731.38,733.38, The background color will be Aqua
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,733.38,734.38, As you can see here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,734.38,736.38, I have put a main tag here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,736.38,737.38, And here it is written
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,737.38,738.38, P I am first
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,738.38,739.38, Then P I am second
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,739.38,741.38, So here you can see
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,741.38,742.38, Wherever the first child of the main
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,742.38,743.38, P is
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,743.38,744.38, Which is here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,744.38,745.38, Which is P
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,745.38,747.38, Is the first child of your parent
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,747.38,748.38, So this class will be applied in this
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,748.38,750.38, So look here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,750.38,752.38, Its background is Aqua
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,752.38,753.38, It is not
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,753.38,754.38, But I will tell you again
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,754.38,756.38, That such things are very less used
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,756.38,758.38, When you develop web
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,758.38,759.38, So you people
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,759.38,760.38, What to do about the
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,760.38,761.38, Seudo classes like this
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,761.38,762.38, What to do about them
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,762.38,764.38, What to do in the description
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,764.38,765.38, That I will put links
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,765.38,767.38, About such things
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,767.38,769.38, So the additional reading material
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,769.38,770.38, If you want to see more
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,770.38,771.38, Seudo classes
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,771.38,772.38, The link is in the description
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,772.38,773.38, You will get it
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,773.38,775.38, Maybe I will put it in the pinned comment
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,775.38,776.38, And if I forget
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,776.38,777.38, Then please remind me
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,777.38,778.38, And you have not given the link
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,778.38,780.38, So I will give all the links to you
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,780.38,781.38, From there
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,781.38,782.38, You can read about such selectors
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,782.38,783.38, But now we will come to this course
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,783.38,785.38, And we will read about the main things
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,785.38,787.38, Because we have to come to the projects very soon
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,787.38,789.38, And make good real-world apps
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,789.38,791.38, And then we have to do back-end
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,791.38,792.38, And do database
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,792.38,794.38, So we will have to build
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,794.38,795.38, A little pace here
17,CSS Selectors MasterClass,795.38,797.38, I hope you are enjoying the course

18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",41.56,46.0, You don't click on the star and don't even click on it.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",46.0,50.400000000000006, You won't do that either. Click on the star and click on it.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",50.400000000000006,54.400000000000006, And I have put the source code for you. You can also access it. I want you to enjoy it.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",54.4,61.76," So, what do you do while enjoying it? As I have made this folder here, I will click on it and open it."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",61.76,70.24," As you can see, this will open in VS Code. If you don't have an open with code option, which many people say that it is not an open with code option."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",70.24,74.16," So, I have a suggestion for you. What do you do?"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",74.16,80.0," You install VS Code again, run its setup again and see which options I have checked."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",80.16,85.28," Now, I will come to the video and make a file named index.html and place a boilerplate template."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",85.28,90.56," And here I will write CSS Box Model. After writing CSS Box Model, I will make a style tag here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",90.56,94.72," With this help, I have made you guys... Oops, I made a style tag."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",96.72,100.48," Is it too fast? No, it won't be fast. Okay, it will work."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",100.48,103.76," So, while making a style tag, I will add styles here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",103.76,107.03999999999999, And I will tell you how Box Model works in CSS.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",107.12,109.84," So, let's first understand the concept of Box Model in CSS."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",109.84,112.64, What is the concept of Box Model in CSS?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",112.64,118.80000000000001," Look, in CSS, everything is Box. Whatever elements we have made from HTML, they are all Box."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",118.80000000000001,125.60000000000001," Whether we have made a container, whether we have made a div, whether we have made a span, they are all Box in CSS."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",125.60000000000001,129.68, And there are some things in that Box that I want to show you.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",129.68,135.76," So, if you can see in the commuter screen, you will see that I have explained the concept of CSS Box Model here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",135.84,143.04," CSS Box Model means that outside your content is padding, outside it is border and outside it is margin."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",143.04,145.28," So, this concept should be given to you."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",145.28,149.76," Another thing that I want to tell you is that, as I have made a div.box here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",149.76,152.64," I have made a box here, I will write IMA Box."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",152.64,156.95999999999998," And here, if I show you its preview, it is IMA Box and this box is mine."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",156.95999999999998,159.2," Outside this box, there is some margin and padding already."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",159.2,163.12, Which you will know when I will add a background to it.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",163.20000000000002,167.6," So, I will write .box, which means Class Selector."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",167.6,171.92000000000002, I have selected Box and I will say background color is aqua.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",171.92000000000002,174.0," So, this box's background color is aqua."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",174.0,177.6," If we do it rightly, we can document the format so that we get good formatting."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",177.6,181.12," Now, you see, there is some margin padding already in it."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",181.12,183.92000000000002," What I will do is, using a universal selector."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",183.92000000000002,187.84, It happens that our browser plays a little understanding from its own side.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",187.84,192.0," It says that if the developer has no brain, then I will put my own brain."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",192.08,194.72, And it adds margin padding to it.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",194.72,196.32, It adds many styles.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",196.32,200.32, That is why we need to reset CSS sometimes.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",200.32,203.92," So, I have written m-0 here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",203.92,206.72," Sorry, m-0 is written, so margin is 0."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",206.72,208.64," p-0 is written, so padding is 0."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",208.64,209.76, These were the M-Ed shortcuts.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",209.76,210.96, And what will happen if we do this?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",210.96,211.92000000000002, It will be completely hidden.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",211.92000000000002,214.0," Like, the spacing was coming here, it is not coming."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",214.0,215.68," So, I have written IMA Box."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",215.68,216.64," So, let's do one thing."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",216.64,218.16, Let's write IMA Box.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",218.16,220.24," And here, I will write div.box."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",220.24,222.72," And here, I can add multiple classes."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",222.72,224.08," Box 1, Box 2."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",224.08,225.68," So, I have made a box."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",225.68,226.96, Box 1.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",226.96,227.60000000000002, Okay.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",227.60000000000002,229.12, And I have made a box.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",229.12,230.32000000000002, Box 2.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",230.32000000000002,233.52," So, whatever I will select the box and put the properties,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",233.52,235.36, it will be in this element and in this one.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",235.36,237.76000000000002," Because, look, we can give one element multiple classes."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",237.76000000000002,239.20000000000002, I had told you earlier.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",239.20000000000002,241.12, You can give one element multiple classes.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",241.12,244.0," And here, you can see, I have given it box and box 1."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",244.0,245.44, I have given it box and box 2.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",245.44,248.48000000000002, And I will simply write IMA another box.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",248.48000000000002,249.76000000000002," Okay, this is box 2."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",249.84,250.64, This was box 1.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",250.64,251.67999999999998, This is our box 2.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",251.67999999999998,253.51999999999998," Now, what I will do in box 2?"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",253.51999999999998,256.4, I will write .box2 and .box1.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",256.4,258.08," Now, understand what I have done here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",258.08,261.36," Look, I will write that property which I want to give with both the boxes."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",261.36,263.76," Or, if I have like this, if there are 10 boxes,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",263.76,265.92, I will give it in 10 of 10.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",265.92,268.15999999999997, I will write that by doing .box.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",268.15999999999997,270.0," And some properties will be like this,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",270.0,274.08, which I will give individually in box 1 and box 2.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",274.08,274.96," So, what I will do?"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",274.96,277.76, I will give box 1 classes and box 2 classes.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",277.76,280.08," And if you want to give any element more than one,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",280.08,281.28, then you can give it space.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",281.28,283.28, Can we give more than one ID to any element?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",283.28,284.24, Tell in the comment section below.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",284.24,285.76, Let me see how much understanding you have.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",285.76,288.08, Make two interactions and tell in the comment section below.

18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",297.59999999999997,300.0," Now, here you see, I have written .box1."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",300.0,300.8," So, what can I do?"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",300.8,302.56," Suppose, I have yellowed the color."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",302.56,303.03999999999996, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",303.52,304.64, I have yellowed the color.

18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",305.92,307.52," By doing color yellow,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",307.68,308.96, I will do color red.

18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",316.96,319.68, Box model says that the CSS content will be here.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",319.68,321.12," It will be outside the padding,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",321.12,323.44, outside the border and outside the margin.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",323.44,324.15999999999997, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",324.15999999999997,327.44, And the total height or width of any element
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",327.44,328.64, will be combined.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",328.64,330.08, This will be the place to be the element.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",330.08,332.71999999999997, Remember the height and width of total height and width.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",332.71999999999997,334.88, Total height means that the place will be the same.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",334.88,335.44, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",335.44,336.96," So, you should know this thing."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",336.96,339.35999999999996, We have seen this much in the CSS box model.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",339.35999999999996,339.84, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",339.84,341.91999999999996," So, I have applied different classes here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",341.91999999999996,342.71999999999997," Now, what will I do?"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",342.71999999999997,346.71999999999997," I will say, I will give a little padding in box1."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",347.52,349.28, And I want to give a 10 pixel padding.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",349.76,351.44," So, if I give a 10 pixel padding,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",351.44,354.15999999999997," then from all sides, 10-10 pixel padding will come."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",354.15999999999997,356.24," And to see this, you can inspect it rightly."

18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",382.24,383.6," So, by clicking on box1,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",383.6,384.56, this element is selected.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",384.56,385.76, I can come here.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",385.76,386.0, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",386.0,387.6, Look at this. I removed it like this.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",387.6,390.0," Now, if I come here, I can see everything about it."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",390.0,392.24, I can change the color of this color.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",392.24,392.88, Temporarily.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",392.88,394.0, I will change it temporarily.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",394.0,395.84000000000003, Because its source code is written here.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",395.91999999999996,397.84," So, the one I will change here will be permanent."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",397.84,399.59999999999997, The one I will change here will be temporary.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",399.59999999999997,400.15999999999997, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",400.15999999999997,401.03999999999996," So, I will not do it now."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",401.03999999999996,403.84," I am telling you that from here, I can preview by changing the temporary."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",403.84,408.0, How will it feel if my box's color becomes white.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",408.0,409.91999999999996," If I reload it, then it will be fine again."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",409.91999999999996,412.55999999999995, And I will select this box and come here to the computer again.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",412.55999999999995,413.76," Now, as soon as I come to the computer,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",413.76,415.35999999999996," look, I can see a box."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",415.35999999999996,418.79999999999995, And this box is exactly the same box that I have shown on codebidhari.com.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",418.79999999999995,419.28, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",419.28,421.35999999999996, You will get to know from this kind of box that
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",421.35999999999996,424.32," this particular element of your box1,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",424.48,426.32," the width and height of it,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",426.32,427.68," after that, how much padding is there in it?"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",427.68,429.92, I have given 10 padding from all sides.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",429.92,431.52, There is no border.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",431.52,433.12, There is no margin.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",433.12,433.59999999999997, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",433.59999999999997,437.6," So, in this kind of element, we have given all these things."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",437.6,439.04, Let's put a border in it.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",439.04,439.28, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",439.28,441.76," So, I have put padding in box1."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",441.76,442.8, I am doing this in the work of SERP guys.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",442.8,443.12, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",443.12,445.03999999999996," Remember, I am doing this in box1."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",445.03999999999996,445.6, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",445.6,447.2," While coming back a little,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",447.2,448.71999999999997," now, what will I do here?"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",448.71999999999997,450.08, I will put margin.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",450.08,452.08, And I will put margin of 5 pixels.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",452.08,454.15999999999997," And as soon as I put margin of 5 pixels,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",454.24,455.04, what will happen?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",455.04,457.20000000000005, This element looks like this.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",457.20000000000005,459.6," So, the background of the element does not remain retained."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",459.6,460.16, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",460.16,461.6, What does this mean?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",461.6,462.8," This means that,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",462.8,465.12," now, if I put pink color on you,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",465.12,465.44, okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",465.44,467.12, Suppose I put pink color on you.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",467.12,468.16," So, you will be pink."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",468.16,470.40000000000003," But if I throw pink color on you,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",470.40000000000003,472.32000000000005, or anything will be there on you.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",472.32000000000005,473.6," So, this was a very strange example."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",473.6,476.8, But I will tell you that the content outside of it is padding.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",476.8,477.12, Okay?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",477.12,478.16," So, if I give padding,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",478.16,481.44000000000005, the color of the background comes in the padding area.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",481.44000000000005,483.44000000000005, Because it looks like padding content.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",483.44,485.84, And the content outside of it is margin.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",485.84,487.44, The element outside of it is margin.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",487.44,488.88, Content element is inside.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",488.88,489.84," See, this is the whole element."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",489.84,490.88, This is the content of the element.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",490.88,491.44, This is the padding.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",491.44,492.16, This is the margin.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",492.16,496.16," So, the background color of our element will remain in the padding area."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",496.16,497.44, It will remain in the margin area.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",497.44,498.4, You have to keep this in mind.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",498.4,499.6," So, I gave margin here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",499.6,501.12," So, you see, 5th margin is here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",501.12,503.04," Now, I will tell you the way to add border."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",503.04,504.56," If I write border here,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",504.56,506.15999999999997, and I will tell you about the border.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",506.15999999999997,506.88," But for now,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",508.48,509.12," if you understand that,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",509.12,510.8," if I write border 2 pixels,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",510.8,511.28," solid blue,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",511.28,513.04, then the border of 2 pixels is here.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",513.12,514.16," And here, you see,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",514.16,516.16, I have given 2 pixels border here.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",516.16,516.88, Okay.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",516.88,519.28, You can see that the border is here.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",519.28,519.92, Okay.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",519.92,522.16," So, this border is visible to you here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",522.16,522.9599999999999," And you can see here,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",522.9599999999999,525.5999999999999, this is my content and this is the border.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",525.5999999999999,526.48," So, here, what happens is that,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",526.48,528.16, there is a DPI factor in our display.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",528.16,530.8," Because of which, the actual border will be seen here."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",530.8,532.16," But this is pretty much,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",532.16,536.4," how you can see margin, border, and padding in your element in real time."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",536.4,536.9599999999999, Okay.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",536.9599999999999,539.04," So, I hope you understood something."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",539.04,540.8," Now, I will tell you here,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",540.8,542.16," how you can see,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",542.16,545.12, the width of your element is calculated.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",545.12,545.4399999999999, Okay.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",545.4399999999999,547.92," Now, I have given the width of it."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",547.92,548.88," Let us say,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",548.88,552.0, or I will give the height of this element.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",552.0,553.04, 200 pixels.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",553.04,555.12," So, I have given its height to 200 pixels."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",555.12,556.56, And its height to 200 pixels.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",556.56,558.64," Now, I will inspect you and show you something."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",558.64,561.52, And I will take you to the computed values.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",561.52,564.0," So, see its height is 200 pixels."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",564.0,564.56, Okay.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",564.56,567.36," And you see, as I have kept it on the content,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",567.36,568.3199999999999," so this is the content,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",568.3199999999999,570.0," I have kept it on the padding,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",570.0,571.28," I have kept it on the border,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",571.28,572.24," I have kept it on the margin,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",572.24,573.12, so it is showing margin.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",573.12,575.12," Now, here you will see,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",575.12,579.52," the element, its actual height is 200 pixels."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",579.52,580.88," Then it will connect to 10,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",580.88,582.64," and it will connect to 220 from 10,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",582.64,584.0799999999999," then it will connect to borders,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",584.0799999999999,585.76, then it will connect to margin.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",585.76,588.0," So, as soon as I connect all these things,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",588.0,590.88, then this space will come out here.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",590.88,594.9599999999999," But, how much height or width of a particular element is,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",594.9599999999999,597.6, the total width and total height is generated by this formula.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",597.6,598.48," What we do is,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",598.48,600.48," we connect both the left and right padding in width,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",600.5600000000001,601.9200000000001," left and right, both the borders,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",601.9200000000001,603.52," and left and right, both the margins."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",603.52,604.24," This is the total width,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",604.24,605.2," that means, how much space will be generated"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",605.2,606.64, with the margin element.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",606.64,607.28, Okay.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",607.28,609.12, I hope you understand this.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",609.12,610.72," And if I talk about the element,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",610.72,612.8000000000001," that how much space is surrounding the border,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",612.8000000000001,614.5600000000001, then you will connect all these things.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",614.5600000000001,615.2, Okay.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",615.2,617.52," But now, I would like to tell you one thing here,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",617.52,619.9200000000001," that if I put a CSS property here,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",619.9200000000001,621.44," which I can directly put here,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",621.44,623.04," I can add it in the styles here,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",623.04,624.72, I can show you any CSS property.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",624.72,626.16," I will do this, and then I will red the background,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",626.16,628.72, and its background will get red temporarily until I reload.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",628.72,630.4, Okay. But I will put it here.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",630.4,632.16, Okay. What I will do here?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",632.16,634.16," I will write here box sizing,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",634.16,635.92, and I will write here border box.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",635.92,638.56," As soon as I write here box sizing, border box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",638.56,641.28," you will see here that its actual width,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",641.28,643.36," sorry, height is 176."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",643.36,645.36," 176.8 is because,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",645.36,648.3199999999999, because 176.8 plus 20 is how much is it?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",648.3199999999999,649.84, 196.8.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",649.84,653.04," And after that, the border will be combined and total will be 200."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",653.04,653.6, Okay.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",653.6,655.28," We do not include the margin here,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",655.28,657.1999999999999, because the margin is outside.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",657.1999999999999,657.84, Okay.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",657.84,659.28," The margin is not included,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",659.28,660.8," whenever we set a height,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",660.8,662.9599999999999, and give box sizing property here.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",662.9599999999999,664.64," See, try to understand that."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",664.64,667.12," When I say that its height is 200,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",667.12,669.04," or I say its width is 200,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",669.04,670.56," so with width is 200,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",670.56,672.48," if I did not put this box sizing border box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",672.48,673.76, listen to this carefully.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",673.76,675.04, Listen to this carefully.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",675.04,677.52," If I did not put box sizing border box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",677.52,678.88, then what will happen?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",678.88,680.56," Then the actual content,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",680.56,683.76," if I talk about the height of it,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",683.76,684.4, then it will be 200.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",684.4,686.56, I will explain you with the example of height.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",686.64,689.52, 200 will be the height of its content.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",689.52,692.0799999999999," Then if you talk about the total space around it,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",692.0799999999999,693.8399999999999, then it will be added.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",693.8399999999999,694.4, Padding.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",694.4,696.9599999999999, Then there will be border added on both the bottom.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",696.9599999999999,698.8," But if I say box sizing border box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",698.8,700.64," so basically I am saying that the 200 height,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",700.64,701.68," I have told you,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",701.68,703.68, it is not the margin that is
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",703.68,705.28, the border and padding are included.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",705.28,706.2399999999999, It is not the margin.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",706.2399999999999,709.28, I am telling you by including the border and padding.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",709.28,711.4399999999999," Where I have done the box sizing border box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",711.4399999999999,714.4," this means that the height of my element,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",714.4,716.0799999999999," which I have written as height here,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",716.08,719.44, this height is my border and padding.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",719.44,721.2800000000001, I have written both by combining them.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",721.2800000000001,722.4000000000001," That is, by combining both of them,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",722.4000000000001,724.48, content plus border plus padding
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",724.48,726.08, should be my friend.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",726.08,727.0400000000001," Box sizing border box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",727.0400000000001,728.24," when I am saying this,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",728.24,729.6," so everyone tell me in the comment,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",729.6,731.9200000000001," that if we wrote box sizing border box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",731.9200000000001,733.12, then what am I saying?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",733.12,734.72, I am saying from CSS that
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",734.72,736.1600000000001, A CSS is God.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",736.1600000000001,738.1600000000001, I am giving you this height.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",738.1600000000001,742.0, I am giving this height by combining padding and border.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",742.0,744.96," That is, content plus border plus padding."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",745.0400000000001,746.4000000000001, That is my friend.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",746.4000000000001,747.84, This is the meaning of my height.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",747.84,748.48," So, one way,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",748.48,751.12, box sizing border box changes the definition of height.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",751.12,752.5600000000001," The first definition of height is,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",752.5600000000001,754.4000000000001," the first definition of height is,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",754.4000000000001,756.96," that it will not be included in this,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",756.96,758.8000000000001, the border will not be included in this.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",758.8000000000001,760.1600000000001, This will be only the height of this element.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",760.1600000000001,761.44," As you can see here,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",761.44,763.76, I will remove this from 176.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",763.76,765.9200000000001," By the way, I can remove it temporarily from here too."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",765.9200000000001,767.76," I will uncheck the box sizing border box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",767.76,769.52, then look at its height.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",769.52,770.8000000000001," And then this pair,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",770.8000000000001,772.64," then this pair,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",772.64,774.88," okay, so after combining both of them,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",774.96,777.36," the total height of this will be 200 plus 20,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",777.36,780.08," 220 plus the number of borders that are calculated,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",780.08,781.04, that will be summed up.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",781.04,782.08," Okay, but,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",782.08,784.24, here I want to tell you one thing.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",784.24,786.24," If I say box sizing border box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",786.24,787.4399999999999," then what happens is,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",787.4399999999999,790.24," that as soon as you write box sizing border box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",790.24,793.4399999999999, the height of this will be reduced from 200.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",793.4399999999999,794.88," And this way it will be adjusted,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",794.88,796.4," that by combining padding and border,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",796.4,797.2, it will be 200.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",797.2,799.76," Okay, I hope that makes a lot of sense."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",799.76,801.44, I hope that I have explained it to you.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",801.44,803.44," So, there was a very important concept,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",803.44,805.6800000000001, which I wanted to tell to all of you.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",805.6800000000001,808.08," And now the concept that I am going to tell you,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",808.08,809.6," that will be fun for you,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",809.6,810.48," that will be fun for you,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",810.48,812.72," because in that, I will tell you about"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",813.2800000000001,814.8000000000001, the margin collapse.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",814.8000000000001,816.5600000000001," Okay, and this concept,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",816.5600000000001,817.9200000000001, you should definitely come.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",817.9200000000001,819.6," So, I will take you all again,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",819.6,820.72, in the computer screen.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",820.72,821.84, This was our code.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",821.84,824.5600000000001, I gave you 5 pixels margin.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",824.5600000000001,827.5200000000001, Suppose I give exactly these things in border 2.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",827.5200000000001,829.2800000000001," Okay, and let's increase the margin a little."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",829.2800000000001,831.12," To make the fun of it,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",831.12,832.4000000000001," let's make it 25 pixels margin,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",832.4,833.84, so that the spacing of life increases.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",833.84,836.4, And suppose I am the same to same thing.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",836.4,838.56, I will just keep the color red of the other element.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",838.56,839.52, Same to same thing.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",839.52,840.8," And I will also blacken the border,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",840.8,842.48, so that it looks a little different.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",842.48,845.12," Okay, rest of the values are same."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",845.12,847.04, You can also see in this box.
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",847.04,849.1999999999999," Now, you tell me honestly,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",849.1999999999999,852.3199999999999," that the margin on all four sides of this box is 10, 10, 10, 10."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",852.3199999999999,854.88," The margin on all four sides of this box is 10, 10, 10, 10."
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",854.88,856.56," So, here we should not have seen this space,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",856.56,858.64," double the space,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",858.64,859.76," put your mind again,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",859.76,860.56," and tell me,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",860.7199999999999,862.4799999999999," that all four sides of this box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",862.4799999999999,864.56," the margin on all four sides of this box,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",864.56,866.16," if I select this element,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",866.16,867.5999999999999," then 25, 25, 25, sorry,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",867.5999999999999,869.1999999999999," 10, 10 is not 25, 25,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",869.1999999999999,871.1199999999999," okay, 25, 25, 25,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",871.1199999999999,872.9599999999999," then this element is also on all four sides,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",872.9599999999999,874.56," 25, 25, 25,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",874.56,877.52," so this distance should be 50,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",877.52,878.64," see, 25 is enough,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",878.64,879.76," look at my arrow above,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",879.76,881.1999999999999," look at my arrow above,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",881.1999999999999,882.4," and this is also 25,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",882.4,883.3599999999999," this is also 25,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",883.3599999999999,884.8," so this is also 25,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",884.8,885.76," why not 50,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",885.76,887.1199999999999," above element should be also below,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",887.1199999999999,888.8," and below element should also be below,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",888.88,891.92," here comes the concept of margin collapse,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",891.92,893.68, what is the concept of margin collapse?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",893.68,896.24," The concept of margin collapse is that,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",896.24,899.28," if two elements of margin overlap,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",899.28,902.3199999999999," then the maximum margin will be just once,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",902.3199999999999,903.52," like if I consider,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",903.52,905.04," I have given 25 margin in this,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",905.04,906.0," there is 25 margin in this,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",906.0,907.8399999999999, how much is the maximum of 25 and 25?
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",907.8399999999999,909.04," 25 is equal to 25,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",909.04,910.88," then the margin of 25 will be just once,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",910.88,913.12," if I give one of them 35,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",913.12,914.88," then 25 of 25,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",914.88,915.68," then it will be 35,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",915.68,917.76," so this difference will be 35,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",917.84,919.76," so margin collapse is called this,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",919.76,922.3199999999999," so if I show you a good example,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",923.12,925.12," of margin collapse images,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",925.12,926.72," I hope I will get an image,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",927.52,930.24," that I can explain margin collapse,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",930.24,931.2," so basically what happens,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",931.2,933.36," if I have a box A,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",933.36,934.16," I have a box B,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",934.72,936.16," this image looks very good,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",936.16,937.28," to explain this concept,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",937.28,938.88," if I have a box A,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",938.88,939.68," I have a box B,"
18,"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders",939.68,941.68," I have given 30 pixel margin in a box A,"
