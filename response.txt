In your Sigma web development course, we cover ID and Classes in HTML in Video 9.

The content of Video 9 is divided into two main sections: explaining what IDs and classes are. 

For example, starting from 0 seconds, I initially explain 'And now I will tell you what are ID and classes.' And then around 49 seconds, we dive deeper into the topic and discuss 'the ID and classes are attributes of the element.' 

By watching Video 9, specifically focusing on these timestamps, you can gain a better understanding of how IDs and classes work in HTML.
