  "text": " What's up guys, you are back in the Sigma Web Development course. I'm really very happy that you guys have given so much love to this course. Like this course with high energy. Because for this Sigma free course, Sigma Chats are always liked. In today's video, I will explain you guys how to see a website's basic structure. Along with that, I will tell you guys a mobile trick that will help you to know how you can preview your websites in your phone. I have a request for you guys to write in the comments section if you know HTML. That will help me structure this course better. In this video, I will tell you guys about ChatGbD. Because there are a lot of things going on about ChatGbD. In the upcoming videos, I will also give you quizzes. So, be careful and learn all the concepts. Let's go in the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to the computer screen. And now we will talk about how to create a website with a basic structure. In this folder, I will create a folder called Video3. New Folder Video3. And I will shift right into Video3 and open with code. And here you can see that my theme is blue. And a lot of people have said that blue is not good. Look, the theme is your choice. If you want to change the color theme. You can change your color theme. I can use the GitHub dark one. I can use GitHub dark. It's your choice. To create a new file, I will put index.html. We had already talked about writing the title of the page, writing the content here, and then using the link tag here. Using the emit here, I can link style.css. I am doing it so fast because I have already talked about it in the previous video. And here if I write script.js here. And here I write, let us say alert, hello. So I will not tell you again that if I put a script tag here, just before the body, and after that, I put script.src here and script.js. And then by clicking here and opening with browser, this will come hello. And here if I red the body's background, then it will be red. I will not tell you all this. Because I have already told you all this. I will tell you all this right now. What does this structure mean? Why did you write so big? This is a doubt for a beginner that we can't write the title and content directly. What is the need to write so much? So I will tell you how much you need to write. I will reload it. Look, the content here is here and it turned red here. Now you have seen here that I needed to reload the page. You must have asked me why I needed to reload the questions. When it already reloads live. So look, I changed the CSS file. When I change the CSS file, at times we need to reload. If you are using HTML file, you are doing changes, you don't need to reload the changes of HTML file. Now here, what I will do is I will come back and I will explain to you. This is a basic structure of any HTML website. First we write the doc type HTML. Then we write HTML tag. Look, this is the opening tag of HTML tag and here is the closing tag. This is the opening tag of the body and here is the closing tag. Here is the opening tag of the head and here is the closing tag. That is, the problem in this is the content of the head. What is the problem in HTML? It is the content of HTML. According to that, the title is the content of the title. Now what is the content of the meta? The meta is a self-closing tag. There are two types of tags in HTML. One is self-closing tag and the other is pair tag. What is pair tag? Your opening tag is a closing tag. So this is the basic structure of the HTML website. Now here you will see that the background is red. Whose background is this? This is the background of CSS. If I remove the CSS from here and say that remove it quickly. What will I say with CSS? Remove it quickly. And as soon as I say remove it quickly, it will have to be removed from here. I will reload the page. You can see that it has been removed. Similarly, I can say it from JavaScript. Remove it quickly. You see, I said from here that the alert will also be closed. Okay. So you see, I will reload it now that the alert will also be closed. So I added CSS and JavaScript in the HTML content. This additionally used the functionalities of CSS and JavaScript to link this HTML page. I already told you about the title tag. This is used to set the page title. Now you just have to give the meaning of this that you see the title here. The search engines that are used here also use it. That is, if you will write here from the search engines if you are Google, code with Harry HTML. So the code with Harry's HTML introduction, HTML working, I have put all the titles on the page. You see here, the HTML introduction is the title of the page. So these titles are used by the page and passed through the search engines. Now I will change the page here. So here the title of HTML working. Now I will change the page again. You see here, the title of the HTML installation is done. So the titles keep changing. Along with that, as I will change it, it will keep changing, it will keep changing, as you can see. Okay. So the title of the HTML pages doesn't just mean that you can see it here. It is also very useful in SEO. And they tell you what the content inside the page is. So they describe the content of the page. So that I know what the HTML execution is here. The meaning of HTML execution is that how the HTML is being executed. I am being told about this page. So changing the title of the page is a very good SEO practice. So we will make a website with any framework. We will keep changing the title of the page. Now here the head section. The meta data of the page is inside the head section. Like the title is done. And you can link it with any script. Along with that, there are other meta tags. I will tell you about them later. Meta tags basically means how the HTML document is. It is told about it. Keywords are added. Descriptions are added. Meta description is a very important keyword for SEO. Meaning, what page you can write about here. If you go to my website, you will find the view of the page source. That it is a meta description tag. It is a compressed HTML. So don't get confused with it. But here you can see that it is a meta description tag. Which describes this page. If we talk about Google, then meta description shows Google here. Now I want to show you that the dog type HTML. What happens in the head section. Meta tags, title tags, script tags, link tags are also there. The script tag can be added to the body. And what are the differences. We will talk about it in the course. But here you can see that I have added CSS again. Then the body is the main content of the website. Which shows you on this page. The one that shows you on this page will be the body. Whatever you put in the body will be shown here. And whatever script you put will be executed. Now by putting a script here and by putting a script in the head. What will happen? I will tell you in the course. But this is a basic structure of the HTML website. Lang is equal to en is an attribute. It is an attribute with any tag. Lang is equal to en. So the value of which is en is an attribute. So what values are used. Which is told about this tag. Like the name is used in the meta tag. The name is equal to description is an attribute. And you will hover in the VS code. You will know many things about it. I have hovered on the name. So it is telling you about this attribute. Why and how it is used. Now most of the content that is in the body. Mostly you will copy the HTML raw. Mostly from the code with the .com website. You will copy the source code here. If I talk about the forms. You will copy it in the form page of HTML. And you will start making your form. And you will modify it. So it is very important to copy and paste. As a senior developer you should know. Where to copy and paste. And when to do it. And I am not saying it is a sarcastic. I am not saying it is sarcastic. This thing will always remain the same. Now you type it or copy and paste it. Obviously you will prefer to copy and paste it. Because this change is not going to happen. The form will remain. And if you copy and paste it. Then your time will be saved. Then you have to put your mind in innovation. Which thing can not be copied and pasted. So you will understand it as a sigma rule. That you will copy and paste. Which is to be copied and pasted. And where you have to put your mind in innovation. That can not be copied and pasted. So you will save your time and put your mind in innovation. The most important part of being a senior software developer. Is to where to copy and paste from. Which stack overflow question to copy and paste from. And how to paste it from. Where copyright code was there. 2024, 2026. Whatever you understand. This is my copyright statement. But this statement is very bad. Now I will tell you about a technique. From which you will develop this website. Whatever we develop here. You will be able to see in this mobile. Now listen to the steps carefully. Right click. Open the terminal. And write IPConfig. If you are in the old version. Then you can open command prompt or power shell. When you enter the IPConfig. You will see here. IPv4 address you will get to see. 192.168.1.199. Now I will copy this IP address. I will copy this IPv4 address. And I will write in my settings. Live preview. Local IPhost address to host. This is written on the local IPhost address to host. This is written. I will write on this place. IP address. And after doing this. I will restart my VS code. You will have to ensure one more thing. That you go to your wifi settings. Your network. Do private network. Public network should not be there. Private network should be there. Network and internet. Wifi. Whatever wifi you are connected to. Do private network. And now you will do right click. Show preview. So you see here. Your IP address. You will get to see. Slash index.html. I can use this on my phone. So I will put this IP address here. So I put 192.168.1.199. 0.5,000. You can also get 3,000. Whatever is your port. You put it. And here you see. My website is previewed in mobile. This trick is very useful. When we want to preview in our mobile. Because nowadays most of the websites are seen in the phone. So we want our phone users. To enjoy our website. And we are developing in the computer. So that testing will be done. If you have not put a review in the first video. So I will request you to come to the first video. And review your course. In the last video I told you to review it. Put an initial review. How did you feel about seeing so many courses. Write an initial review there. As soon as you write initial review. People will know what is the initial review of this course. You give me 5 stars. Along with that. You should access it in the playlist and description. Click here to book it. Click on the star. This will become a bookmark. And it will start showing in your bookmarks. I have bookmarked it here. Click here to save it. Many people have accessed the playlist. So I want everyone to access this playlist. Bookmark and save this playlist. So access the playlist. Like the video. Do the same for your village and uncle.
