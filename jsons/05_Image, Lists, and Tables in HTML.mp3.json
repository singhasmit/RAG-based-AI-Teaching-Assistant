  "text": " In this video, we will see how images are made, lists are made in the HTML and tables are made. So, if you like the video, I know very few people like videos on YouTube. But if you do, thanks to you, I get the motivation to bring free courses like this because of your support. So, let's start the 5th video of Sigma Web Development course on the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So, guys, I have come to my computer screen. First, I want to tell you to bookmark GetUp.com. In fact, bookmark this repository so that you get all the code. Second thing, click on the playlist and bookmark it. Click on the star and click on the save. Now, the first thing I will tell you is about the image. What is image in HTML? So, what will we do here? We will make a folder here. In the name of video 5, we will get a new folder and video 5. You know, I will try to open with code with this. I will make it very fast because I have already told you. But if you want to see this welcome page repeatedly, then check the show welcome page on start-up. And you will not get to see this again and again. But what are we doing? We will make index.html, control, zoom in by mouse wheel, we will toggle the screencast mode so that you will know which button I am pressing and why I am pressing. Now, I will put the exclamation mark and bring the image abbreviation here. And here, I will do the view word wrap. You have to work very hard. You can see that your word wrap is closed. So, what will happen here is that the horizontal scroll bar will not come. What will I do here? I will write images here. First of all, I will write images here. And I will simply bring an image here. Now, you can bring images from the internet. I will write here. Let us bring images from here. Train key. Okay, train key images. Because we have run a lot of trains in this course. So, we will bring the train key images. Why will we bring the same image? I will do the same images. And here, in the video number 5 folder, there is a CMS file in the Sigma Web Development course. In fact, I will do one thing. I will cancel it. I will take its snippet. Because this is a CMS extension. I will go to PNG. So, I have pressed Windows, Shift and S. It is a shortcut for Snipping. If you do not know, then you will know through Sigma Web Development course. You will know that if you press Windows, Shift and S, then your Snipping tool opens in Windows. No one should know this. Tell me in the comment section. Okay. Now, what will we do? I had done Windows, Shift and S. Then, I got into talks. So, you click here and save it. The floppy description of the save here. You click here. And go to Downloads. Go to Sigma Web Development course. Save it in video 5. Okay, saved it in image. Now, there is an IMG tag in HTML. The way you will put it, SRC and Alt are required attributes. In fact, you will not write Alt, but it is recommended. I will tell you what are these attributes. First, if you write in SRC, image.png. You can see this image here. So, image.png. And I will put it in Alt. Train Image. Okay. Now, if I show it to you by previewing it in the browser. See, it looks like this. This is our page and this is the image of the train. What happened by doing this? Alt, what we wrote, where did it go? You can say, I will tell you where it went. I put it in Alt. See, we did not show the thing in Alt. Suppose for some reason, the server cannot see any image. Okay, then what will happen? Suppose I wrote image2 by mistake. Now, image.png is not here. So, what will be the error? I will show you. So, here the Alt will be displayed. And this kind of error image will be displayed. Which will tell you that you have put the image correctly. You have done something wrong. Here, the server's URL is not there. Okay, these kind of things are shown. And there, Alt is shown. So, the user will know what is the purpose of this image. Okay, and if I come back here, you can put the Alt in the image like this. If I do not put it in Alt, then what will happen? If I do not put it in Alt, then the Alt text will not come. Nothing will happen. So, you will not want that when your server has an error, then give this image as a user. You will want something like this. The scenario is like this. The user will see you like this. The train image is written like this. Okay, I hope you understood. So, the image is straightforward. There are two more attributes of this image. The two attributes are very important. One is the width. Which is width in pixels. If I do 23, width is equal to, then you can see. In fact, I will correct the image first. I wrote image 2 by mistake. Image.png is here. So, you can see here. I have taken 23 pixels. Which is very small. So, I will do 230 pixels. You do not need to write Px in this. When we write width in CSS, then we will see that we need to write Px. Here, we write only width is equal to the number in double quotes. As you can see. Okay. So, if I bring this here, then you see that this is a small image. If I give it height, I mean, I give it height too. I said, if you keep the height of 230, then its aspect ratio will be reduced. So, it will become a little stretched. Because it has also made its width 230 and height 230. As you can see. If you want height 230 and width automatically adjusted, then you can use height attribute. Now, remove the width. So, the height of 230 will be fixed. And the width will be adjusted automatically. Now, look. The width has been adjusted automatically. And the height is taken. Now, what happens is that through CSS, it can be adjusted to width and height. And in the CSS section, we will see that why this width and height should be set. We should always set one thing from width and height. Such that, when our page load is there, then the image of our page should not be in the page at all. I will tell you in the coming videos. But, you can understand that these width and height attributes I have told many people that they have heard that they have been deprecated. They should not use it. But I say that they should use it for SEO purpose. Why should they do it? I will tell you in the coming videos. Where I will tell you about Core Web Vitals and SEO. For now, you can understand that width gives the image and height gives the image. If someone has put one of them, then the other one automatically sets. And these values are in pixels. And you don't have to write Px or pixel. You just have to write this number. And that's it. This is an attribute, height. And it is an SRC attribute, an alt attribute. You can also use the style attribute in this. In fact, you can use the style attribute with almost all the tags. So this was the image. Now we will talk about the tables in HTML. In HTML, the table tag is very useful. I will tell you what is the table tag. You get to see the table from the table tag. Now I will copy this table from here. And when I will copy this table from here, then you will see that my page will look like this. So this table of HTML. Where is my preview page? Here it is. Look at the name, HarryHundred. Now if I put a lot of things here, I will put some things here. I will put some things here. I will put the name. And here I will put the designation. I will put the designation of Harry. And I want to put more things here. I will use the Alt Shift bottom arrow. I will use the Alt Shift bottom arrow. And here I want to write that favorite language. And I want to write here. JavaScript. And now you see that this table will be like this. Name, destination, favorite language. So what is this? How does it work? Here we used table tag. Table tag is TR tag. Which is Table Row. You will get to see what will come in this row. Now if you want to use it as Table Heading. You say that this is my Table Row. That is this row. Name, destination and your favorite language. What will come in this row? And what will come? Here you can see that it will be a heading. So I will use TH. And I will write Table Heading. And I will write only one time. So the first one that will be TR, I will write TH. Now we put the heading. Then we will put the data. So we will put the TD in Table Row. Which stands from Table Data. And here you will put rows in all the TRs. Anyway, what will happen? Your rows will be added. So here I will write SAM. And this is also a programmer. And this is also a programmer. And this is also a programmer. We will see from CSS how it can be given a border. It can be styled. But this is shown in default. And yes, I know this is next. But you just understand that Table works like this. Now there are rows, spans and call span attributes. Now you see here that the means of how many rows your TD will span. For example, Let us say I write I want SAM and programmer. Earlier we were taking one Excel. SAM was taking one Excel programmer. So I will write in two cells. So I want to write that I don't want to write in program. I just want to write SAM. And I want to write here that call span is equal to 2. So call span is equal to 2 means that SAM will take place of two columns. What does it mean? It means that it will take place of two columns. That is, it will show you how SAM will look. I will show you. So it took place of all these columns. So the call span means how many columns will be rounded. By default, one column will be rounded. And one cell will be rounded. To demonstrate this, I will explain it to you with Excel. In Excel, you can understand that this is a table of MRI, HTML. Sometimes I want to span two columns of one data. So here we use Merge cell. And here I write SAM. In HTML, this is done. We use call span. Sometimes we want to vertically merge. I want to merge these two cells. We use row span. And who will we use the row span with? We will use the row span with TD. We will use call span with TD. We will use the row span. So we will use this way. I hope you understood this. When we will make the projects of HTML, you will understand it better. But I will show you the row span quickly. So if I write row span is equal to 2, and then I write another TR here. You will see that this table is showing this way. To explain this better, I will put a CSS style here. I will add a style sheet. And I will name this style sheet as style.css. You don't need to understand CSS. I will tell you already. I will write in TD 2px solid black. I will tell you how it works. But for now, you can understand that I have put this. To explain you. I said that this row is Harry, programmer and JavaScript. I said that the row span of SAM is equal to 2. I said that the row span of my Java will be 2. So here Java will be 2. So here you can see Java has taken 2. So when Java has taken 2, I don't want to write Java in the next one. Because its row is already in the next one. So I will not write Java in the next one. I have called it as Span 2. So what happened with this? It was Harry, programmer and JavaScript. I said that the call span of SAM will be 2. This SAM will be 2. And Java will be 2. So you can see that it is exactly the same. It has taken 2. So this way, you can use the row span and call span in HTML. In HTML table, we can add captions. And to add captions, we can use the caption tag. So I will show you that in the table, if we use the caption, you can see the page in this way. You can see that the caption will be added here. Now the CSS has also changed the font size. But for now, it looks like this. The caption is added. You will have to see the employee details in this way. Along with that, you can also add header and footer. You can add t-head and t-foot here. For example, if I add content in t-head and t-foot, like this, if I add something like this, you will get to see t-head and t-foot. You can see that the header and footer has come here. Now I will tell you about another tag called br tag which is used to add line break. So after the image, you can see that there is a line break here. So this is the header. And after that, I will add footer. I will not add it here. So I will add the table after that. So this is my table footer. Now I can change it from CSS. Now here, I can group my header and footer content in this way. So what will be my table header that I have written here, I can group it. I can add it in t-head. Along with that, the content that will be in the table will come in t-body. So what will come in t-body? Something like this, my table and content will come. Like you can see. And after this, if I write t-foot here. And I want to add some data at the end. So I will add another t-head. Like you can see. I will write it and document it. Then it will be a better format. So I want to add t-head like this. And I want to group it in t-foot. So this is the way to group. I have put some t-hearts in t-foot. I have put my main body in t-heart. And I have put my table header in t-head. And obviously nothing will change. I have just grouped it. Here, I will write footer here. So that you will know that this is footer. I will write foot here. And you can see that the last row is foot. What is the benefit of doing this? We have targeted it from CSS. So you will use this very less. But you can do grouping like this. Your full table will come here. Foot content will come here. And body content comes in between. But you can write it here. But ideally, head, body and then foot comes. I hope you understood. So that's all about HTML tables. You don't need to know more. And now we will talk about list. List is very important in HTML. Because we will use list a lot. There are three types of list in HTML. We have ordered list and unordered list. And definition list. The most used unordered and ordered list. Let's see the unordered list first. Sometimes we want to have unordered data. Like I write here UL. So I will write UL here. That means unordered list. I can write Li in this. And I can write Harry. And then I can write Rohan. And then I can write Shubham. So when I write Harry Rohan Shubham, UL will come like this. Unordered list. There is no order. There is no 1,2,3,4. But if I want it to be ordered, I can write this with oil. If I make its opening, closing tag with oil. And keep the rest same. Then it will be ordered list. So here it will be 1,2,3. You can do capital ABC. You can do Roman numbers. You can do CSS help. You can see here. UL is in this image. So it came like this. You can see in this image. It is in this. So it is 1,2,3. This is the definition list. Definition list is very less used. It is a preview. I have added heading here. I have written DL. DL means definition list. And then DD. So here definition term is definition of office. So it comes like this. You can change it with CSS. It is very less used. But you should know about it. Interview. You can ask what is definition list. So it is a preview of this code. I am not writing it. But try it out. We will see the unordered list first. In unordered list, I have told you. You can customize it. By using type attribute. For example, if I square you. Type is equal to I write you. So in UL type is equal to I have written. It has appeared like a square. Similarly, I can Circle the type in UL. I can do square. Disc by default. I can do square. I can do circle. Along with that. You can add any list of items. in this list. Now let's see the unordered list. In the unordered list, you will write Li. So it will come like this. But you can use it. Type is equal to I. When you use type is equal to I, you will get upper case roman numbers. Type is equal to I, you will get lower case roman numbers. Type is equal to I, it is default. You don't need to do this.
