  "text": " In today's video, we will learn about Core Web Vitals and why Core Web Vitals are necessary. Like this video and keep high energy. The thing is that your website should be in your iPhone, iPad, Android, Surface Pro 4 devices. Because we have to give good experience to all users through our website. In this video, we will also learn about Chrome's hidden tool which is called Lighthouse. And how you can use it to enhance your website. So write in the comment section, Sigma Batch OP. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to my computer screen. And I will make a new folder which is called Video 6. Video 6. And in Video 6, I will click on VS Code as always. And today, I will tell you about SEO. First of all, I want to tell you what SEO is. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. You can see any website and it is called SEO. Let's take an example of Amazon.in. I opened Amazon.in. So Amazon.in needs to be loaded as soon as possible. So that they can get their products in the search. Google is a search engine. Google's responsibility is to show good pages to users. So Google will only show those pages which will be fast. Information is very good. And along with that, there are some things that are good for users. For example, there are two pages from the editor. One page has told about dog food. The other page has also told exactly about dog food. But among these two, page 2 is very fast and loads well. So Google will give more preference to it. Along with that, there are core web vitals which Google considers to rank two pages. First of all, there is content. Content is the most important. If you have content on the other page, then you can rank it without the code web vitals. But if you are competing with a page with almost the same content, then you will see core web vitals. And if your core web vitals are good, then you will be given preference. So the first thing that comes in core web vitals is your CLS. You see this video here which I have run on the web.dev website. You will see that someone comes to your website and he is ordering to cancel it. So the time he canceled it, the above thing became visible. And he shifted the layout. And the order was completed. But the user wanted to click on the top if the order was not complete. In this way, the user experience is very bad. And as you saw in this video, this shouldn't happen. So our CLS should be at least. Now what is the definition of CLS? Cumulative layout shift means how much the age is shifting while loading. Suppose you have loaded the page and you get to see this first. This was above and after that, when this part of the term was loaded, then all this shifted down. The layout shouldn't shift. If you put vit and ride in images, then the layout shouldn't shift. The next metric we are going to talk about is LCP. And LCP stands for largest contextual paint. This means that if a user is viewing a page, then the biggest element is on it. For example, the biggest part of this image is loading in how long. Meaning the entire page will be loaded. But the biggest element which is most important is loading in how long. The meaning of web.dev and Google should have a good LCP score of 2.5 seconds. Meaning the biggest element should be loaded in 2.5 seconds. After this comes the third metric which is FID. Which stands for first input delay. First input delay means that if a user clicks on an input element like button or any type of input is given on a page, then how long does that input process? For example, if you click on a button, then the button click browser processes in how long? And the meaning of Google and web.dev should start processing at least 100 milliseconds. So these were three core web vitals which are very important. I will tell you about the information that these core web vitals are updated. But these three are very important and you should know. Now I will show you what light house report is and why it is generated. And how these three core web vitals value will be given from there. So I will tell you here. If you will inspect it right click and if you can see it on the right side, then you can click here and run it. You can bring it here again and you can run it here. I prefer to see it down because it is my habit to see it from the beginning. Now here you can see the option of light house. Light house basically generates a report and tells you what can be improved in your HTML page. For example, if I want to see in mobile that how mobile users see my website. So I will click on mobile or I will click on desktop and I will close this tab. I will click on mobile and here I will click on analyze page load. So this will generate a report for me in light house. You can see here that a report has been generated. Performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO and PWA are all shown here. Now you can see here that some things are showing in red. That is the scope of improvement in the page. Now here you can see that properly size your images. 2.7 seconds fast your website can be loaded. So all these suggestions are given to you by light house. And if you incorporate these suggestions, then your website will be loaded very well and the user will have a good experience. Now you can see here that image elements do not have explicit width and height. So you should give width and height. The width and height attribute of image that we had read in the previous video should be used. So that it is reserved in your browser. When we set width and height in HTML, then space in the browser is reserved. Otherwise, if we do not set height and width, then what will happen that our browser will not tell us how much space we have to reserve. And the longer the CSS load, the lower the page will shift. So we do not want our page to shift during loading time. If our page starts shifting, then if we click here, then when it will shift from the wrong side, then it can be done. We click here and sit. Suppose there was an image here, I click here. And the time I clicked here, this image was loaded and all these buttons were shifted down. And instead of clicking here, I will click on the image. This is called cumulative layout shift. So this kind of shift is not preferred at all. Google does not prefer at all. And this should be at least. You can see that the space is very less. So we have to keep the cumulative layout shift at least so that our user can get a very good experience. So here we get a lot more suggestions and this is for our mobile. Now we can generate desktop reports. And that will generate desktop reports. So as you can see that it has generated a report. 92 marks in performance. There are 82 in accessibility. 75 in best practices. And 75 in SEO. Now here you can see that all the good things are told here. And all the lighthouses from the scope of improvement. So this is a hidden tool that we should use. Now I want to tell you about meta tags and meta description. So what will I do here is that I will make a new file. I will name it index.html. And after making one HTML file, the first SEO element that I want to tell you is title. Your title reflects your page content. So this is a very good SEO practice. Whenever your page change is happening, you make the title like this. That reflects your page content. Because if you want your website on Google, then that title will come according to you. You can write the code with the index of Google here. And if you write like this, then this is the title of the page. And this is the title of the page that YouTube has put in. This is the title of the page that Instagram has put in. This is the title of the page that GitHub has put in. So if you put the title on the page and the title reflects your page content in actual. Then your website will rank very well. Now here I will put the content. And I will put an H1 and write Harry here. And after that I will write a paragraph here. And here I will write Lorem45. Now I have written Lorem45. I will write the view word. Why did I write 45? This is a very good question. I wrote 45 because I have written Alci and 4 or 5. So I have given 4 or 5. I have written 23 because they are also around. So there is no other reason. Now I will quickly preview it here. I will open in browser here. See how it is showing. Now this document is written. If I leave it like this, then this is a good SEO practice. I will write about Harry here. And I will write code with Harry here. Which is my website. And what will happen if the title is reflected here. Like you all see. So what will happen if you do this? That my website will increase the chances of seeing in Google. After inspecting, I will also take out its light house report. And I will see what is the scope of improvement. The light house report will be very good. Because there is no such thing that I should improve. But when I put images, I will get suggestions. Like put width, height. Along with that, I will tell you another trick. In the mobile, you can see how your website looks. So you all click here. You can see here the computer. And if you choose responsive, You can see how your website will look in any device. So your website is responsive. You can see it here. If you want to see in a specific device. Like in iPhone 12 Pro. Your website is iPhone 12 Pro. Resolution will look something like this. Now don't say why it is not 15 or 16. 12 Pro means big iPhone device. Understand it. In such a big device. How will your website look? It is simply being told to you. Now you can see how it will look in Surface Pro 7. By clicking here. How it will look in Google phones. You can also find this. And if you want to take a general view. In my website responsive device. In any device. Suppose in iPad. How it will look. If you don't have a device here. Then you can choose responsive. Take out your device approximate. You will get all the devices. Your website should look good. How it will look. I will tell you this in this course. Now if you click here again. Then it will close. The responsive view will close. And as it closes. Your website will look like this. I will close it. I will come back. Now I will tell you about meta text. Here I will write meta. Here meta DESC is coming. I will click on meta DESC. And here I can give my page description. I will give you this. This is the page. This is the page about. This is the page which contains. Description. About. Harry. Okay. And here you can write any page content. Whatever you want. Suppose you write what is SEO. Okay. What is SEO. You wrote what is SEO. Look here. This page has put this meta description. SEO stands for this in simple terms. Now it is not necessary that a search engine. Passes your meta DESC. It will not do this. If it feels good. It will pass and keep your meta DESC. If you have not put meta DESC. Then it can be generated from your content. Meta DESC. So this is the responsibility of a search engine. What will Bing do. What will Google do. We do not know this. But our page should be exactly to the point. Especially if we are writing a blog. And we want our organically ranked page. So here you can see that I have put meta DESC. Now a meta keyword used to be very popular. But now the meta keyword. It has been deprecated. Meta keyword is not used at all. Meta keyword looks like this. But it is believed that. Meta keywords do not rank in SEO. Because people abuse it. Suppose you have written a page about pets. And you have written what is SEO meta keyword. So it will rank in SEO. I will correct this double quotes. If I put meta keyword here. Then it is not necessary that a search engine will consider it. Some search engines do this. Meta keywords do not believe. They say we should not see your meta keywords. Do not put them. Meta keywords used to be very popular. But it is not. Your page content is now passed. And now the time is coming. So especially more. Your content will be understood. What is your content value. It will be understood. It will be ranked accordingly. Now if you want to know exactly about these core web vitals. For example, if I inspect it rightfully. And go to the lighthouse. And remove the lighthouse report for desktop. Some core web vitals come. Like LCP comes. Then FCP comes. First contextual paint. Now you can see that everything is 100. Look here. There was nothing in this content. But here you can see that. What you have to do is. Pages with WebSocket cannot enter. Back, Forward, Cache. There is WebSocket in it. Because we are using this extension. Live preview. Otherwise it is absolutely right. Accessibility is also 100. Everything is 100. It is a very good page. PWA is progressive web apps. Which we will not make now. But you see here. First contextual paint. Largest contextual paint. Total blocking time. Cumulative layout shift. Speed index. If you want to know about all this. For example, what is the first contextual paint. The user who is going to see. How long it has been painted on the browser. So if you want to see this. You have to go to web.dev. Web.dev is a very good website. What is talking about all this. And you can see here. That you keep talking about this. You can learn what is this. What is the thing. If you want to learn PWA. You can learn PWA. About all these things. There is a lot of good content here. But we will focus on making this code. Httml, CSS, JavaScript and websites. This thing should have come according to me. Because of which I told you about it. If you have not accessed the Sigma web development series yet. Then do access it. Access the playlist. Bookmark it. Click on the star. Click on it. Save it. That's all for now. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. ."
