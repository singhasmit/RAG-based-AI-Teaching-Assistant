  "text": " Today we will start the Sigma Web Development course with high energy. Because in this video I am going to make you a profitable web developer with zero. This course will be modern because web development has changed over time. Many new things have come. Many things have come in JavaScript which makes the work very easy. Many technologies have come which will make your work very easy. This course will be for those who don't know anything. You know that zero is for you if you know about web development. We will start with zero but we will raise the bar like anything. What we will learn in this course I will tell you in a while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also be successful by learning web development. You will get notes, cheats, references during the course. This course is going to be different because I will tell you the technologies according to your experience in this course. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. There will be course content, complete web development, front end, back end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you the course content in a few days. But you keep faith that you will become a full stack developer. In the future you will be given a lot of projects during the course. And in the end you will make some good projects so that you can become very strong on web development. According to me, project based learning is the best way to learn. So I will make you a lot of projects. And if you agree then write in the comment section below. Because when you comment, my face gets a smile. So do comment. I want to give you the trust that after finishing this course, you can make any kind of website from the beginning to the end. And during this course, I will make a lot of websites like this so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with our first video of our Sigma web development course. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, I have come to my computer screen. And now follow me as I am doing. I have downloaded Google Chrome browser here. You also download Google Chrome browser. I am not saying this, it won't work. But you have to do exactly what I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly what I am doing. And along with that, you will be able to follow exactly what I am doing here. I will go to Google and I will write down download VS Code. Now what is VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If you are in Windows, I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system, then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process is exactly the same. You can see that in the folder where I downloaded, there is a VS Code. And as you can see here, this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here. And here you can see that I can double click on VS Code's setup and install it. So simply, you have to install VS Code. Install the game as easy as possible. You can quickly agree here. This lies in the slide. This lies in the slide. This lies in the slide. This lies in the slide. This lies in the slide. This lies in the slide. This lies in the slide. This lies in the slide. And I am the fastest reader in the world. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. I will do it. It is important here to check both the icons. Check both the icons. It is very important to check it. If you want desktop shortcuts, that is, if you want to get a shortcut in the desktop, then you can create a desktop icon. And then we will do it. We will do it. We will install it. If your PC is fast like mine, then it will be so fast. But if your PC is slow, then there is no problem. So, it will be a little slow. Nothing more will happen. Now, I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because I want you to follow these videos. Like I have shown you in the video. You will get a notification. So, if you want to follow this course completely, ideally you should subscribe. With that said, our VS code has been downloaded. I have opened the VS code. Don't be afraid of this. Beginners, don't be afraid of this. And I am saying this again. If you know something already, we are starting beginner friendly here in initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming videos. So, stay tuned. Hi. I will request you to tell me in the comment section what is your level. Beginner is advanced or intermediate user. Tell me in the comment section where does web development come from. Beginner advanced intermediate. Please, you do comment this. Now, what is VS code here? I have downloaded it. Let's understand this. So, if you don't know what is VS code, let me tell you that VS code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now, you can edit Harry by code in the notepad. So, yes, do it in the notepad. It will be done in that too. Yes, I am not doing it in the sarcastic way. It will be done in that too. Let's set up here and show you what is in it. Which makes it a little different from notepad. Look here, let's set up here. I will not browse from color themes here. In fact, I will do it. I will keep it dark modern. I will keep theme here. And I have done all this in the next section. After this, in the next section. You can close the welcome if you want. But first, I am telling you some tips here. That's it. This is your VS code here. It has started. This is the VS code screen. You can see here. You can make a new file or a new folder. But I will recommend you to close it. Yes, you can close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep its name. You guessed it right. Sigma Web Development Course. We will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. Understand that we will do it related to the course. We will not do much. You will shift here and do it rightly. If there is an app in Windows. You can see here. There is an option called open with code. This option called open with code. This particular folder helps you open it in VS code. You will select it here. Now what you will do here? You will say yes, I trust this file. Click on this file and say yes, I trust the authors. And this folder is now open. If I click on plus, there is a new file to be made. Suppose I wrote index.html here. Write it now. If you do not know what I am writing. Write it. Enter it. And after that what I will do is that I will write here. Hey, I am your first HTML file. Suppose I wrote this. Here you can see this ring. This is white color. This ring means that you have not saved this file. If you click on this, it will save. I will recommend you to go to the file and enable the auto save option. As you type, you will not see this ring. Your file will instantly be saved. As you type. And I recommend this too. We will not use control s. Otherwise, if you want to save from control s. You can disable this option. I would like you to click on gear. Click on settings. And search here mouse. Mouse. Now here you see editor mouse wheel zoom. Check it. I will tell you what will happen if you check it. Just close it by checking it. Now you do not have to be afraid. What is VS code? How is VS code? What is this? What is this? What is this news? But you do not have to see this. Now you will simply scroll by pressing control. So what happens is that your font size changes. Now I will show you a magic. It is a very simple logic. In the downloads, what happened in the folder called sigma web development course? What happened? This file was created. Index.html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. I will make a file called this.txt. I will write this is this. So what will happen? This file will also be created here. You can see. So this folder and this VS code are both in sync. Now I will open this file from here with notepad. And I will show you. This file will be opened in notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my wish. But I will not use notepad. Because there are some things in VS code that do not give me notepad. And I want me to get those features. I do not want to overrun you. But I will show you that what is there in VS code that you do not get in notepad. If I write here. Hit html. If I hit enter, it automatically gives me the opening closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. It gives me a boilerplate template. If I click on this, then see the basic code of html came here. We will discuss about this later. You do not get overwhelmed at all. But as I want to tell you that. What kind of profit did this VS code get? Why did we not use notepad or VS code? And this feels. It feels so good. It feels like a developer. It feels like a hacker. That feel is also important. Then there will be a confidence to do coding. Now for Mac and Linux users. I want to comment on something exactly similar for you. I am using windows because I do not have windows laptop. I cannot use 3 laptops. Linux, Mac and windows 3. I cannot use them all together. So exactly the same things will remain for you. In fact, I should say that similar things will remain. Exactly the same things will remain very similar. Okay, so you will be able to follow along very easily. So do not take tension at all. I will tell you about some extensions. In a little while and you will enjoy. Use those extensions and you will also say. It was fun. What did you recommend? But I will tell you in a little while. And this is criminally underrated. I am telling you that you will enjoy. I would like to tell you about that too. You will do it here. You will do it right. You will click on command palette. There are many options for VS code here. You do not need to know all these options. As we will move forward in the course. The features that will come in use. I will tell you about them. And you can use them. But what I will do here now. I will toggle the screencast mode. You do not have to do this. But I will do it. So you will know. I clicked. So you see I will type anything. If I press caps lock. Then it will click caps lock here. So you will know when I pressed any button. Now this thing is not relevant for you. But I just want to tell you that. Screencast mode. Screencast mode. We can change its settings from here. Now here you see the vertical offset of screencast mode. What does vertical offset mean? If I zero the vertical offset. Then it is up. If I set vertical offset to 70. Then it is down. I will set it to 60. If I set it to 60. If I set it to 80. Then it is up. From bottom. How much will it look up. I have set it to zero. In fact I have set it to one. Now I will type anything. I have set it to this. It will look down. Which is ideal. So I will close this.txt file. I will close the settings tab. These are tabs. Basically they are tabs in chrome. They are tabs exactly. So I hope you have understood what it is. What we have written about it. I have forgotten. I will tell you step by step. Exactly what is it. You can also close the welcome page of VS Code. By any chance if you are zooming in VS Code. Which I will do. Because I am recording video. Add control plus. Add numpad plus. Look down. I have shown you. I am zooming in. I am zooming in because I am recording videos. So ideally I want you to see from the side. But when I am coding. I don't zoom in that much. So you have to keep this in mind. So these are related things from VS Code. I want to tell you how websites work. A website basically works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is Client. One is Server. Who is Client? Who is the second? Server. Who is the third? Browser. Who is also called Babu. Browser. So Browser. Client. Server. What is this Client? What is this Server? Client who me? You. We all. Who is the browser? Who is the browser? This is Chrome. Hello Chrome. I am Client. I will tell you from Client. When I write codewithherry.com. Suppose I write codewithherry.com. So basically what I say? I say from this browser. That by doing this, give me codewithherry.com website. Or if I write here youtube.com. I say give me youtube.com website. I say browser. Give me youtube.com. I want to watch youtube. Browser says you want youtube. Take it. So I will enter youtube.com. So from server.com. Bring youtube.com. Do you understand? From server.com. Bring youtube.com. He passed it and showed me this screen. This work happened so fast. Because my internet.com is very fast. It is so less. Nowadays people are faster. But still according to my locality. It is very fast. So with this fast internet speed. All these things are very fast. So Client server sends a request through browser. Browser is my assistant. I will do the same with browser. It will help me to bring this web page from server. Who is managing the server? They are managing the server of youtube.com. They are managing the server of youtube.com. And there is some code written in that server. Which sends me this kind of code. When I write youtube.com. This code came. How to convert this code into this? This is for browser. Which means how to show me this? This is for browser. So Client browser says something like this. What's give me youtube.com. Browser says what's you want youtube.com. Wait. I will ask youtube.com. Then browser goes to server. Means it requests server. It says give me youtube.com. The server will give it here. It will say here. It will say here. Error. It will say server error. It didn't get it. Whatever the response is. Ideally it should be 200. The response code is 200. With that response. Which is our browser. It comes back to client. And shows this kind of page. I hope you have cleared it. Client browser server. Okay. So Client browser has. Browser has. Browser has. Back to browser. Client has. So this is how it works. This is a little more important. Let me tell you once more. When you write google.com. On any website. Google.com. So client. It says give me google.com. Browser says. Guru dev. You want google.com. Wait. I will give you server. So browser goes to server. And it gets google.com. And it gives you. You get google.com. Now with google.com. All the images, videos, whatever it is. All these things are sent. These icons. All these things are sent. These icons. These icons. The URL of these icons is also written in this code. And that too. The browser works. It displays us correctly. So the server. It is a very good thing. It is very good. It is very good. It displays us easily. So the server. It sends the browser a bundle. It sends a bundle like this. And passing this bundle. It shows us this way. It works as a browser. Now whatever further interaction. The user. With this page. The browser will get additional requests. If I write and inspect. And then go to network. And here I write. Suppose. Harry brother. I wrote Harry brother. So look at all the requests. For images. And also all the requests. So as you interact. As you interact. As you interact. As you interact. And you have to send additional requests. To the browser. So by combining. You can consider it as a restaurant. You have given an order. That is on the request page. You have given an order. You have taken an order. A waiter took it. The waiter went to the kitchen. He sent it to your order. You consider the kitchen as a server. And finally. When the kitchen gave the order. So what did this waiter do. Which is working as a browser. The waiter saw you. Order again. It is possible that the order. Can not be made in the kitchen. For some reason. It is very less. Order again. And you did not get it. But it happens sometimes. Similarly here also sometimes happens. This error is seen. 4 not 4 error. Or 500 error. The server is not working. Such an error. So such an error is seen. Whenever you see. Even then it is told to you. But ideally 200. That is the response of OK. And you get such a web page. So you can consider it as a restaurant. So whenever you write. Google.com slash mail. So if Google.com slash mail is available. Then you will see. And if you write. Code with any. Contact. If it is available. Then you will see. If it is not available. Then 4 not 4. Or 500 error. So you will see a 500 page. You will see. Whatever server will send. So this cycle is going on. The client sent me a request. The browser sent the server. The server then processed the request. After that the server sent the browser. Data again. And whatever data sent. The browser showed the client. Then the client did something. The browser sent the same request to the server. Then the server sent something. Whatever data the server sent. The client returned it. And so on. So now you will say. All this is fine. But what is the backend? What is the backend? What does the backend mean? The backend is how the server is processing the request. Now if you believe that you have a blog. There is a lot of data in the blog. So what will you do? You will store every web page of the blog separately. Or you will generate that content dynamically. You will generate that content dynamically. I will take an example of Google. If I search here Harry by. So you can see here. You can see that Google's header. These are the links. This format does not change at all. If I write here. Shubham. I have written Shubham here. So here as soon as I write Shubham. Now see. When I wrote Harry by. I am showing the very similar content of it. So what does Google do? The server of Google. The backend. The backend processes the data in a way that it can send it for this kind of HTML corresponding query. That is when you write Shubham. Then send it. When I write Harry by. So send this. So the way to generate this thing. That is the backend through which system it is. Now this backend can be Django. This backend can be Flask. This backend can be Node. This backend can be PHP. This backend can be Ruby on Rails. And the data in the backend is used. The backend code is not visible to the client. This is the front end code that sends the server. And how did the server make this code? We do not know this. Because this is running on the server. If you are confused, then do not be confused. You will understand all these things. We will see the backend in the future. Now we understand how the front end works. The front end is made primarily with three languages. HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the three languages that you need. If you are making a website. Every website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In most of the cases, it is needed. If you use only HTML, then it becomes a very basic skeleton of the website. After that, when you use CSS, you can style it. The way this button is visible, then only CSS is visible. Along with that, this button is red. This button is curve like this. This is all thanks to CSS. The edges are visible here. This is all thanks to CSS. So, the CSS works is to style a page. What color and what will be the color of the button. All these works are done through CSS. There is a beauty of CSS. HTML is a very basic page. This is a standard that is agreed. Anyone who makes a website, will make it on HTML. So that the browser can understand how to parse. The browser works is to parse HTML. And HTML is a skeleton. This is a standard. Anyone who makes a website in this world will make it on HTML. The skeleton will use HTML. This is a standard. This is a standard that is made so that everyone makes the same kind of pages. If someone is making a browser, then you have to parse the same language. If you have learnt 80% HTML as a beginner, then you are good to go for web development. Now, there are some things directly related to HTML. For example, if I write a lot of HTML codes, I am writing HTML code like this. I have used the emitter abbreviation. Don't worry about how I have written the code. I will write this is HTML. And I can open this HTML file directly. And as soon as I open this HTML file directly, You see, this will open like this. I can open it directly by double clicking here. And it opened like this. Now, look, this is written as HTML. But this is not styled at all. This HTML file is very basic. Now, you can run videos directly from HTML. I have an HTML file that I will show you. You can run videos with it. I do the work that I will show you by changing this HTML file. So, we can show videos in this. So, there is a video tag in HTML. If we enter the video, then the video you will upload in SRC will be played. For example, if I put video1.mp4 here, You see, the video1.mp4 is automatically shown by VS Code. This is the advantage of using VS Code. So, you see here, I will reload it. So, this video is automatically shown here. I can play it. To play it, I will have to write controls here. And I will refresh it. So, I will have the controls to play it. I can play it. This is a lot of money. People need it to sell. How much money do you need? I am asking for 130 crores. Final, absolutely. Now, if I put video2.mp4 here. I have put video1 here. I have two more videos. I have some other videos here. If I put it here. And after that, I will refer to them. If I put video2.mp4 here, Then you will see video2. I will reload it and show you. If you put video2.mp4 here, Then you can see video2.mp4 here. And after that, I will refer to them. What is this? This was the look-alike of Ben Stokes. Now, if I do video3 here. Suppose I do video3 here. Then my third video will be there. So, I will reload it. And you see, I can play it. This is the third video. I have gone. I have played video3.mp4 here. So, I will close it. And we can play video4 too. And I have a video4.mp4 here. Where the DJ is playing. So, you see this. So, you can make such things. You can use only HTML. No, you don't have to do anything else. You can play videos with only HTML. You can play images. You can play all this with only HTML. Now, if you want to style it. Suppose, I want a border to it. Or a red background. So, what I have to do for that? I have to use CSS for that. CSS adds beauty to any website. Then comes JavaScript. Which adds interaction to the website. For example, what will happen when I click on search. What will happen when I write code with hr. Like, code with hr is written. And auto is completed here. Why did this come? This is why it came. Because there was a request on the server. And for this query, the results of auto complete came here. So, all these things happen with JavaScript. We call this client side scripting. That is, if we want to do scripting in client here. We want to do coding. Only on client side. So, we can do that with the help of JavaScript. This is also a brain. So, our website becomes beauty with brain. I am talking about the website. Beauty with brain. CSS adds beauty. And brain came from JavaScript. Now, JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic. Like, if you have to change the content without loading the page. Then all this is done with JavaScript. There are a lot of mosquitoes here. So, I will kill these mosquitoes here. Oh, the mosquitoes are not getting anything from here. My racket is working. Oh my God! Like the video because I will eat the current chat for you. So, when I was in college. I was shocked that I have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. First, learn HTML, CSS, and C. Until I remember all the properties. Then, learn JavaScript. But this is wrong. Why is it wrong? Because HTML is only 80% And CSS is only 40-60% And JavaScript is only 50-70% You can start web development. You can make projects. You can make and make and make. You can move ahead. In the future, I will tell you about the impact of chat GPT and web development. So, we will talk about this. You are tuned. So, don't run behind perfection. Take HTML and CSS. Don't think that I will do HTML for a year. I will do CSS for the next year. I will do JavaScript for the next 30 years. I will make projects for the next 14 years. Don't think that. Do HTML. 80% CSS is 40-60% And JavaScript is 50-70% You can learn and make a great website. And as you keep making websites, your experience will teach you more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And you won't know that you have perfected HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While you are making money and working as a professional web developer, you will be earning along with learning. And you will be moving ahead with your skills. Don't think that I will remember all the HTML tags. I will make a website. I will remember all the CSS properties. I will make a website. I will make a website. I will teach you this much. I will teach you only that much. We are going to learn what matters. I don't want you to learn for years. That's why I designed this course. So that you can learn only what matters. You will learn from practice. I will teach you a lot of things in this course. There are 2-4 mosquitoes to learn about the development of the web. Which is good. Our audience is growing. In this course, we will learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will tell you about the tricks in this course. You won't have heard about it. I have learned about the different points in my career. I will tell you about it in a course. I have learned a lot of tricks in my career. I want you to learn all the tricks from the beginning. If you have any doubts in the coming videos, then you can use the hashtag doubt and ask your doubts. I am going to try to answer all the doubts. I will try. I will try my best to solve your doubts. So if you have any questions, technical questions, then please ask the hashtag doubt. Please write the hashtag doubt in the comments. So that I can prioritize the comments of the hashtag doubt. I will try to answer all the doubts as much as I can. You will learn everything in this course. So like this course. If you haven't done it yet, then do smile on my face. Now what is the react, next gs, angular. So these front end frameworks help you to use JavaScript. HTML CSS is a website. It helps you to make the process faster. How? We will learn it in this course. We will learn it in this course. I told you that I will make this course completely different. I will make you to take you from zero to hero in web development. Take your seat and tie it. Because you have taken the ticket of Sigma Web Development Express. I want to give you a good analogy to teach HTML CSS and JavaScript. HTML is like car skeleton. If you paint CSS in it and it is in internal engine car, then it is JavaScript. For example, a skeleton is HTML. If you have skin, then CSS. And brain is like a nervous system. Now I will take you to phobes.com. If you go to phobes, then a website is opened here. And phobes.com is a website that uses HTML CSS and JavaScript. Like a different website. If I click on right click, then the inspect element is opened. Now look here, they have used script in the head. And here they have used link to add CSS. So what I will do here is, I will remove the CSS from here. So what I will do to remove CSS, I will clear all the style tags and all of them using delete key. So as soon as I remove all the style tags and all the link tags, As soon as I have read all their style sheets, look at the state of this page. This page is showing something like this. It is just raw HTML. What size should be of images, how should images be of images, I have forgotten all this. And only raw HTML is written here, which is not styled at all. So phobes.com is looking like this without CSS. Without CSS, it is showing only raw buttons, raw text, raw links. And similarly, I can remove the script accent here to see without JavaScript's website. Now if I delete the HTML tag of this page, like this, I have deleted the head from it, I have deleted all of them, so it has become a blank page. That is, without HTML, this is not even a status. So this is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a web page. I would like to tell you that this course was initially made to be paid, but I changed my mode and converted it to free course. And I thought I would put it on YouTube, so I want you all to be serious. Many people have reached out to me to launch this course paid course. There are many big companies there. But I was getting a voice from the heart, this course should be free. Because when I learnt web development, I can understand that when you don't have a course to learn well, and you don't have the affordability to buy a paid course, then I can understand and I decided that there was a Sigma web development course. It should be launched absolutely free. This course is free, but it is free of charge. As you all will earn crores in the coming time, you all will give me tea, coffee, parties and all the gifts. This is our agreement in this video. So when you start earning crores, you start earning lakhs, then just send me a green leaf or red leaf. But you have to be careful when you start earning well, only after you start earning good. So, while keeping the joke aside, in the next video, I will tell you how you can earn money by completing this course. But I will add light. This is also an important day. Come on, how will you earn money? That is also important. Personally, I do freelancing like this. How do clients come? I will tell you everything in this course. I want to tell you some action items. The first action item is that you should access the playlist of this course. I will give it in the description. Everyone should bookmark the playlist. Press the star button here to open the playlist. Press the star button to bookmark. And there is a save button in the playlist. Many of you have said that the course is paid. We will also buy it. Thank you so much for all the support. I am sure you all love me. I am very proud of that. But this course is going to be free. No technical issues should come. I am putting these videos in the resolution of 1080p. So, you should give it very clearly. But all of you say that the video is in SD. It is in 240p, it is in 144p. You all watch Bali's Wadhu. You finish your mobile's Jio's internet. You watch Bali's Wadhu from morning till evening. And you ask me that these videos are not HD. Some Nagar Pali's Kublao. So, I hope that you all have understood the request in this video. What is the response? How do these websites work? We got a basic idea. How does client-server interaction work? In the upcoming videos, we will see how the website is made. We are going to make our first website in the next video. So, you should be very excited. Because our first website is going to be in the next video. And it might be the first website of some of you. So, access the playlist. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."
