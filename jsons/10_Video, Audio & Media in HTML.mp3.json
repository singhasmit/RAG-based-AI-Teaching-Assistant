  "text": " In today's video, we will learn how to use audio, video and media elements in HTML. We have seen in our very first video that we can embed videos in HTML. Today I will tell you how to play video auto. How to keep muted video and how to enable and disable video controls. Along with that, we will also see a lot of audio that can be shown in a page. So do like this video and stay tuned because the examples I have used are very dangerous for video tags. Let's go to the middle screen. Let's roll the intro. Friends, this time I have made a folder called video 10 and I will not waste your time by opening and opening the code by right-clicking the shift. In fact, I will make an index.html. And the topic of today's video is video. How to play video in an HTML file? How to add video? How to add audio? How to add media? So adding video is very straightforward. I will copy it here which is our video tag. It has an SRC attribute and some other attributes of it that I will discuss with you. But first I would like to tell you that video SRC is equal to what you have here. So if you have video.mp4 then it will be played. I have video.mp4. So let's see. I have put it here with control and I will click here and preview it. And you can see that this video has come. It is a very big video now. So what can I do? I can give it a width. So I can say that width is equal to 555 pixels. And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact I do not need to write PX. I will just do 555. As soon as we do not need to write PX in the image. Here we do not need to write PX here. So as soon as I did width is equal to 555. In fact I do height is equal to 555. So that it becomes smaller. In fact I do it smaller. I do 255. And you see it has come here. Okay. Now I will play it because I have put control. I can play it. Look at this. There is a better road than America. My name is Gopendra Jogi. Where have you been to in the US? I have been to a lot of places in the US. Tell me. Gopendra Jogi. So that way you can play video like this. Now some attributes here are video tag. It is very simple to use video tag. You should have a video. You have given the path of the video. You have given the controls. So these controls will come. You can download it. You can full screen. You can mute. You can do picture in picture. All this automatically presents your browser. But let me tell you about some attributes. The first attribute is SRC. You know Giyal. Put the video here. The name of the video file is SRC. This video file can also come from an external URL. You understand. If I have uploaded another video on Amazon S3. I can also put the URL there. I mean it is not necessary. The file can be on your server or third party. Now what controls do? Ads, video controls like play, pause and volume. Which we saw here in Gopendra Jogi's video. That you are getting to see the controls here. Now what is this thing? The browser automatically sees what control and what will not be in your video. Then see what will auto play. It will automatically play. As soon as the page loads. Okay. So if I put auto play here. I will put auto play here. Okay. Where do you see the road of the market? What is happening here? So see. How is it going here? It is good. So you can see that this is auto play here. Okay. So I will put auto play here. And our next attribute is loop. That is once our video is played. Then it will be loop. Like I will show you. Where do you see the road of the market? So this is again started. Once I finished this. So this is again started by myself. Okay. So this loop works like this. Next attribute is muted. Muted video is muted. So if I write here muted. Sometimes we want the video to be muted. In fact, when I add videos here on code with 3.com. And I demonstrate something. I am downloading VS code. So I use muted attribute. But I don't want that when I recorded a video. If there is any background noise, they will tell you. For example, I want to show you that this is the element. So I will make a video by scrolling like this. I will highlight it like this. So I don't want audio in it. So I will mute it. So you can use muted attribute in your websites. Then poster. Poster is very important. So I have an image here. Download.jpg. If I write here poster is equal to And I write download.jpg. So you will see something like this. Okay. This is how it looks. I will play it in poster. So the video will be played. So like a thumbnail. Okay. I have seen the thumbnail of YouTube video. This is the poster attribute. So you can use these attributes. You know that width and height Specifies the dimension of the video. Like I have seen width and height. So I hope you have understood this. Now what I want to tell you after this is audio. So this is all the attributes of the video. It is straight forward. I want you to make a website. Which I am going to give you at the end of this video. In quick quiz. So listen to the quick quiz. In fact, I will put a quick quiz from the heading. So that I don't forget. I will give you this right now. And this is going to be a fun quiz. And everyone should solve this. But before that. As you write audio here, SRC comes. And I am putting SRC in Sachin.mp3. So I will put it in Sachin.mp3. Now look here. I will reload it. And here audio is not here. Which is strange. Let me see what is the problem here. I will not put SRC equal to many. I will have to write controls here. So if I write with controls, then I will not see audio. Look, now the audio is here. I have seen controls here. I can set the volume of this. So I will play this audio. What is Sachin in Sachin? It is 90 Sachin. Okay. So this is audio. If I mute it, then it will not work. And I can increase it further. 90 Sachin. Okay. You have seen it. So this is Sachin.mp3. What is the audio? Now what we will do? We will see some attributes of this audio. You know from SRC that source. Video file. Okay. Then after this, you know controls. Play, pause, volume. Which we just saw. What will auto play? It will automatically play. If I play here. What is Sachin in Sachin? It will automatically play. Okay. So what will auto play? It will automatically play. This is our audio. After this, the next attribute is loop. What will loop do? It will repeat it. If I want to loop it, then I have played auto play. I will loop it. What is Sachin in Sachin? It is 90 Sachin. Once. What is Sachin in Sachin? Once. So you saw it repeated. Means it was saved once. Then it was saved again. Because I had been looping the audio. Okay. So you saw it. I looped Sachin.mp3. Means it was saved once again. Then it was saved again. Okay. What is Sachin? Sachin was repeatedly saying it. Because this MP3 will play again and again. So there are many other cases. When you want MP3 to be repeated. Okay. So if you want your MP3 to be repeated, then you can use it. Now after this, what will mutate? It will mute the audio. And definitely you don't want to mute your audio by default. You can mute most of the cases. But we sometimes want the audio to be muted. And we can say to the user that we have to listen to it and mute it. What is Sachin? We do this when we have multiple audios. You want to show 5-6 audios at once. You can mute them. The user who wants to play and mute it can see it. So you have control over it. If you want you can use it. Okay. So I hope you understood this. You must have enjoyed it. Now preload. The most confusing attribute. That's why I have explained it in CodeWithRail.com. Preload attribute can be the value of it. The first value can be none. This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio at all. Preload means if you want to fetch the browser data first, then you will use preload attribute. Otherwise you won't use preload attribute. Preload is equal to none. It is the default value. Preload is equal to metadata. The browser will preload the audio information. It will preload the audio. It will preload the entire audio. Preload is equal to auto. It will be downloaded and automatically loaded. So that when the user plays, the audio is saved. Preload attribute works. It is often asked in interviews. Preload attribute. You should know what preload attribute is. Before moving on, I want you to share this playlist with your friends. I am seeing that the interest is declining. As we are moving forward in the videos. I request you to like this video. And as you are doing this repository, you should also start it. Your likes and your star will help me in bringing such free courses. So this was about audio and video tags. I have also told you all the attributes. You should definitely use this. I will give you all the images so that you can try out this. Many people were asking if we can use the replete. I have not used the replete in this course. But replete.com is an amazing website. If you want to use it in your phone, HTML, if you want to run it, It is also a replete app for iOS and Android. So you can try it out. Many people are asking how to record in your phone. But I want to use the VS Code. Most of the people prefer to use it. So I thought I should make videos in VS Code. But I personally use the replete. In fact, videos are also used in replete. The next topic is SVG. It is related to media. SVG is a format. So you can create images. It is a high graphics vector image. You can make circles in it. So SVG is used in the same way. The way it is used. Look at our IMG tab. If I put SVG here, Then this SVG will come here. See, this circle and SVG came here. Video, audio, SVG were these line elements. So we are getting to see them in the line. You have seen here. Now what is here? You can save SVG file separately. You can save SVG file separately. If I write here that I am G dot SVG and save SVG content. If I write here that I am G And I am G dot SVG. So you can see here that I didn't get to see this. If I write here all. And write my SVG image. So you can see here that My SVG image came like this. But I didn't get to see SVG. Why did this happen? It happened because SVG is SVG file in browser. And when you see SVG file in browser, You will put a declaration. I will show you. So I wrote SVG file not showing. So here is the answer of stack overflow. So you have to write this. I will show you. XML, something like this. You have to add this. It is called name space declaration. So you have to add this thing. And now you see here, This is very important. When you make websites in future, You will get into this problem. I will keep getting into it. So I am telling you. The problem you got into, I told you earlier. You didn't get any problem. I told you about problem and solution. Next topic is iframes. Iframes is very simple. You can embed your website from iframes. Like if I want to embed this web page, I can use iframes like this. So I wrote iframe here. I will copy this URL. And paste it here. And you see here, The entire website is embedded. In iframes. You will definitely want to embed it in big iframes. But if you want it to be embedded, You can do it like this. I will increase the height of it. Width is equal to width. Width is equal to 122. Height is equal to 444. So this is how it came. Now definitely you were coming in this width. So it came in this line. But I will increase the width. I will increase the width. 322. So see here, The entire website is embedded. You can see here. You can embed a website. Another use of iframe is YouTube video. If you want to share YouTube video, Click on embed. It will give you iframe code. You can start it any way. If you want to start at a particular time, You can do it here. If you start at a particular point, You will share it. I will show you. I want you to start from here. Start from here. I will click on share. After clicking on share, I will click on embed. I will start at 1219. I will copy it. I will put it in my code. I will comment this iframe. I will put it in the iframe. I will do a word wrap. So that you get the right code. I will show you the document after pasting it. See, this video is embedded here. I hope you understood this. Media is only this much in HTML. It is pretty much okay. You will get to see a lot of things in every topic. Miscellaneous. But pretty much that's all about media. Audio, video, media is enough in HTML. This is what you will use in 95% of the times. I will give you a quick quiz. Your quick quiz is Create a web. Create a web site which shows videos of different categories. And audio of different categories. You can use YouTube videos in an iframe using YouTube's embedding feature. So what you have to do is you have to create a web site where you will get a lot of content. Now you can use video audio tags and use YouTube's share feature. The way I have embedded this YouTube video you can also embed it here. And create a great web site and show me. You can give me a github comment and you can also tell me a code or explain it. But do try this quiz. And write a sigma batch op in the comment section. Access this playlist. Like the video. Write a sigma batch op. That's all for now. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."
