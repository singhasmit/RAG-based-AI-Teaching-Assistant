  "text": " In today's video, I will tell you about the heading and paragraphs. Along with that, I will also tell you about the anchor text. If you have liked this course, then do like this video. Your likes will help me in getting free courses like this. In this video, we will make a small project which will be a bookmark website. This bookmark website will help you in getting all your favorite websites in one place. And you will be able to use it in actual use. So let's start quickly. Write down in the comments below, Sigma batch OP, let's roll the intro. So guys, as you can see, it has already matched in the computer screen. And if you haven't accessed the playlist yet, then you can access it. One more thing I want to tell you is that if you go to github.com, you will get the github repo of Sigma Web Dev course. I have made all the videos in this, and the committee has also made it according to the folder. So you will get it. So you have to access it so that you get the source code. I will also put the video in the description. So there is no problem. Now we will make a very basic website today. But it will be very important for us because it will be our first useful website. So I will not take much time. I will make a new folder in this Sigma Web Dev folder. And I will name it video4 because it is our fourth video. So I will make it by name of video4. I will click Shift right and open with code so that this folder opens in our VS code. After doing this, I will do the same thing that we always do. Index.html, main.css, style.css and script.js. We usually make these three files. If I write CSS, I will write here. If I write script, I will write here. But for now, I will write an exclamation mark here and write in a document like this. My bookmarks. Okay, so we are going to make a bookmark website. I will write code here. So you must have seen these titles. Now I will write H1 here. What happens with H1? You can use H1 to add heading to your web page. We talked about basic structure. We said that this is HTML page. HTML lang is equal to en. Lang is an attribute and its value is en. That is, this page's content is in English. This tells this search engine. Or if anyone is taking this web page link, then he will know that this web page is in English. He can parse this web page. The browser will also know that your web page is in English. Now here is the head in which the metadata, title, page, the CSS link is there. All these things are information. The main content is in the body. Now there is a tag to add heading to the body. Its name is H1. And I am going to write my bookmarks in it. So if I write my bookmarks here, then we will write this H1 tag. And if I want to do it live, I will click here and then I will open it in the browser. So look at this, it shows my bookmarks like this. Now why should we always use H1? Why didn't I write my bookmarks directly? Because I am telling the browser that this is my heading and this is my first level heading. Now believe me, I want to keep two types of bookmarks in my bookmarks. One is the main bookmarks and one is the secondary bookmarks. So I will use H2, that is, the heading of the second level. So I will write here. If you have used Microsoft Word, you will know what H1 and H2 are. But if you don't know, I will tell you that H1 is your main level heading. And the heading of the second level is from H2. I will say that the main bookmarks and secondary bookmarks. I will do something like this. And here I will press Alt, Shift, Alt, Down Arrow. I will do the work. Why don't I turn on the screencast mode? So what I did here, Alt, Shift, Alt, Down Arrow. So this is the replicate. This is the shortcut for VS Code. I would like to tell you another shortcut for VS Code. If you press Alt in your keyboard and after that wherever you click, it will become cursor. If I click here, it will become only one cursor. But by pressing Alt, if I click somewhere else, it will become a cursor. As you know, all the bookmarks want to do the bookmarks code with Hari. So my bookmarks dash code with Hari. I can write something like this. How did I do this? I clicked here. Then I pressed Alt. And wherever I press Alt, I will click there. I will get multiple cursor. Then whatever I type, they will come in multiple cursor. Wherever there are cursor, whatever I type, it will be visible. It will be fun. Like this. So I will remove it like this. And you will see that it will be updated. So this is my main heading. This is my H2. Similarly, we have H6 with H1, H2. Suppose you gave the main heading. After the main heading, you gave a secondary heading. After that, you had to give some heading. And so on. You had to give a lot of subheadings. Then you can give H6 heading. H6 is more than enough. Html has given 6 headings. You will never need H7. If you talk about it in practical life. And if you read it, you can use H6 repeatedly. Because it gets so small after H1. That H6 will become very small. So it will not be so small. Now what I will do here? Alt Shift Down Error. I will replicate it. And I will click here. I will press Alt. I am telling you all these shortcuts. So that your productivity is increased. Now I have put two cursor here and here. I will press backspace and H3. Then I will click here. I will press Alt. I will click here. I will H4 it. And I will click here. I will click here. I will click H5. After that I will click here. I will click here. I will click H6 here. Now what I will do? I will write here using H1. So that you know. I will write here using. I will press space. I will write using. I will write H. And here I have left my work. Click here and have two, three, four, five and six. And you see it looks like this. So you know that H1 is like this. H2 is like this. H4 is like this. H5 is like this. H6 is like this. And H6 is like this. Then what will happen? It will be over in a while. So H6 is more than enough. So I will show you a practical demonstration. For example, this is my HTML tutorial. So here I have given the main heading. After this I have given the word as HTML. Then I have given the features of HTML. I have given this from H1. I have given this from H2. After that I have given something in H2. So I have given something in H3. This is the text and markup language. This is heading 2. What is the main heading of the page? This is the introduction of HTML. After this, this is the sub-heading. I had to give some exercise in this. So I used H3 in it. Then H2 came back. Because it was inside. So H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 are used to build the hierarchy. Okay. I hope you understood. Many people are commenting. You are starting very slowly. So we know. If I tell you something, you will say yes. It is very easy. If I tell you something, you will say yes. Then I will say JavaScript. Then I will say bootstrap. Then you will say yes. It will be done. Then I will say react. Then I will say note. Then I will take the things. Then I will take the things. Then after that, I will go up the level. I had told you that we will raise the bar. This is what I meant. We will do the react when I will make projects there. When I will do dangerous things. Then I will ask them for their comments. Tell me what is the level? Don't talk about the level. The level is going to rise. So these are our headings. 6 headings that I want to keep like this. Now if we want to write a paragraph, You can use P tag. P will enter. Now I will tell you a shortcut trick. If you want to play dummy paragraph in the M8 through VS code, What will you do? You will write LORAM23. Here M at abbreviation is here. This is LORAM23. You can write a word here. You can't get horizontal stroll bar. So you can write this word. Now here you see LORAM. $ $ $ $ Here is a dummy text. Why do we want dummy text sometimes? Because we are making a template. We don't want to fill that template. Suppose you are making a website. Which looks like OYO rooms. Now here OYO become a member. OYO for business. I don't want to write all this. I just wrote LORAM. Now I want to write something here. So I will write 7 words here. I will enter LORAM 7. Then I will give it to the OYO people. You use this to fill the place holder. My plan is that we will make the clones of popular websites. So that you will know how things work. This is also a popular website. If you have used their services, you can tell me in the comments. Now we will see other things. Here is the paragraph. How to style it. All these things are done through CSS. Now in the paragraph, when I wrote LORAM 23, I will enter P enter. Suppose I write LORAM 10. Then only 10 words will come. And if I want to write LORAM 100. If my page will be filled too much, then I can do that too. So this LORAM value trick is very good. Whenever we make a clone of popular websites, suppose I make a clone of Amazon.in. If I make a clone of Amazon.in, suppose I have to write something here. I can't see much text here. Suppose I have to write 3 words here. So I will write LORAM 3. I will not think about makeup products. I will write LORAM 4 or LORAM 3. And I will write LORAM 2. And I will make a template and then whatever is there, it will come in my database. And I can bring it in my text. Many people asked me if this course is going to be ready. Absolutely, I will make you to be able to do the actual industry level jobs through this course. Now let's talk about attributes in HTML. What are these attributes in HTML? Like I used HTML tag. Lang is equal to en, Lang is an attribute. We didn't use any attribute in the body. We didn't use any attribute in H1. We didn't use any attribute in P. But I can use a style attribute in P. Which is called inline CSS. I will red the background color on it. If I red the background color in some way. The color of the background color will be red. It is called inline CSS through style attribute. If you add CSS to style we had learned to add CSS here. But if you add style is equal to you will get this background red. I will show you. I will use this color. This color is looking good. I can also add style inline. But when you make the inline style in industry level we use less styles. Because the sustainability is less. The reusability is less. We want to ship small bundles on the browser. And our website is more optimized. But inline CSS has a style tag. But here style is an attribute. P is a tag. It is a style attribute of P tag. Through which we can style this element. We will learn more about attributes. Attributes basically give an element enhanced functionality. We gave this paragraph a style. This is the background color. To give this background color we used style attribute. Similarly to give properties we use attributes like this. For example, if we talk about link, link colon CSS link has relic attribute hrefc attribute. What can we do with this attribute? We can add this CSS style sheet. For example, background background color I say body first. What we want in body? Don't worry about this. Don't worry about it. Because CSS will tell you all about it. But I am telling you that I am doing hotpink. Listen to another functionality of VS code. This ninja technique is very useful. Over here. And here you can choose the color you want. I will leave it. So, here you can see the background color of my body. How did you like the ninja technique? Write in the comment. Now we are back in index.html. I can remove it if I want. I will comment on it. This style sheet is not left. Which is very natural. The background color was coming from this style sheet. This background color was coming from inline CSS. So, this is very natural. Here I have made this style is equal to background color. Now we are going to make bookmark manager. BookmarkManager.html I am making it for a different file. Because I have told you all about different headings. I am going to make a useful bookmark manager. I will write here. BookmarkManager Now you all know why you are making this bookmark manager. This is made by our hands. This will be our child. We made this. Because you made this yourself. One software you made and one software you made You made this yourself. You can see here BookmarkManager.html I will write here. My Bookmarks. Now I will write here. Primary Bookmarks. And then I will write here. Secondary Bookmarks. In fact, if I do all shift and I write here. Secondary Bookmarks. I can write here. Now I will write Google in a paragraph. I will write it like this. We will write it from the list. But in the upcoming videos, I will tell you how to use the list. For now, you can understand it. Google. Open Google. And I will use Anchor Tag. I will enter A as in A. It is a mandatory attribute. For which link to go. I will write HRAphys. Https.double slash www.google.com It will go on this address. Whenever someone click on Open Google. I will cut this open Google. I will put it here. Content of this stack will be like this. You can see here. This is called Anchor Tag. Which helps us to make links. You must have seen many such links. Now you see here. As soon as I enter the image.html. You can see here. You can see all the bookmarks. Now I will click on it. You can see. When I did not click on it. It was blue. Now I have visited it. It changes color. When you visit it. It has been converted to visited link. I have visited it. I will tell you one more thing. If we want to open it in a new tab. As I am clicking on it. If you want to open it. You can use this wheel of your mouse. You can click on this wheel. I will tell you one more thing. If you want to open a new tab. You can use an attribute. You can write here. Target is equal to underscore blank. And VS Code gives you suggestions. I have written it by entering two. It is written in notepad. It is written in any other cheap editor. So what would have happened to you. It is cheaper according to quality. If you use cheap editor. Target is equal to underscore blank. You have to type it. It gets a little pain. But if you write it in any other way. What will happen now. I am clicking on it. I am not clicking on mouse wheel. I will click on it. I will click on mouse wheel. I can open it. I have written a simple open google. If you want. You can use your favorite website. You can use it. You can use it. I will write here. And here you can see. Facebook.com I will write here. Code withari.com And here we will write. Let's see. YouTube.com Let's see. You can see one thing. If you want it not to be in one line. What will you do now. You will put it in your own paragraph. This is a dirty way. I am calling it dirty way. I will tell you later. But you can close it in paragraph. If you want. I will press shift. I will press right arrow. I will press control X. Then I will press end. All cursors will go to end. Because if you press end on one cursor. Then it goes to end. And then I will press control. I have used very short cut. And many of you will be like this. I have used multiple cursor functionality. I have used multiple cursor. I have used it. This is not a good way to use paragraphs. We never make lists. We make lists. But because we have not made lists. We are using paragraphs. But this will do our job. This will look like this. And the ones we have not visited. Facebook visited. This color is also purple. Kora visited. You can visit it sometimes. Follow wikipedia.com And here is stackoverflow.com We will write the spelling correctly. Stackoverflow Let's capitalize it. And now you see here. Secondary bookmarks. So this is your bookmark manager. And you can make this bookmark manager even better. We will learn CSS styling. If you see this ugly. Don't worry. Don't worry. Because we will do styling and designing in the coming time. Now you see your bookmark. Bookmark manager is your title. And I will write it in H1. Both will be same. This title will be same. My bookmarks will be same here. So you can make a bookmark manager like this. You can use it in actual. If you save it like this. Like my bookmark manager.html. You can copy it and put it on your desktop. You can copy it and put it on your desktop. Whenever you want to open a website. You can just double click it. If you double click it and open it. Then you will have to do it correctly. Open with it. Choose another app. And then choose Google Chrome. Always. I will always choose Google Chrome. So whenever I will double click it. Google Chrome will open. So this was our bookmark manager. I hope you liked it. I have a request. Share it with your friends. I know very few people will share it. But if you will share it. I have a lot of courage. I will try to get more courses like this. Many people are shocked. They are asking me how free this course is. How I will get the benefit of the app. I will find other ways to make more money. But the thing is. I will mark this course. I will put everything in it. I will teach you more with less time. I was very upset with the ad text. Many companies launch paid course. On our platform. Many companies are upset. They asked me to launch paid course. Why are you doing this? You will regret your decision. But hopefully I will not regret my decision. I will make this course free. I will teach you more. How you can earn more money through web development. With that said. I will put the link in the description. The source code. Take it from this repository. Thank you so much for watching this video. I will see you next time."
