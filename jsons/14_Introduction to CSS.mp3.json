  "text": " Guys, today's video is about to start with CSS. We've gone far ahead in this course. We've finished the whole HTML. And out of you, people have shown a lot of enthusiasm. Don't decline your interest in this video. Like this video and write a sigma batch op in the comments section with high energy. We're maintaining such high energy throughout the course. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. And we supplement HTML with some styles through Cascading Style Sheets. The HTML was never intended to create styled pages. That is, HTML's work was to create a basic website structure. And CSS takes responsibility to style the page. There are selectors in CSS who help select any element. I'll tell you in this video what a selector is. How CSS is written. In the upcoming videos, we're going to raise the bar like anything. We'll make real-world websites and such websites like Amazon, Flipkart, Netflix, YouTube. You'll be able to make these websites. I'm very excited. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. I'm in my computer screen. I'll always make a folder here. And I'll make a folder in the name of Video 14. It's really fun in this course. Because honestly speaking, I've never made this course. Now, I'll tell you about CSS first. Why would you use CSS? HTML was never intended to style web pages. HTML was always intended to create a skeleton. There were many tags in HTML that were deployed. Like font tag. Because HTML was responsible for creating a skeleton website. That's about it. After that, CSS was to handle the work. In this video, we'll make real-world websites. If you haven't done the playlist, you can do that too. The source code is coming here. Codewithherry.com. If you go to the notes, you can download HTML's notes. You'll get additional things to see. So, as soon as you click on PDF notes, you'll get HTML's PDF notes. This is written by me in my handwriting. Handwritten in notes. It's written in a lot of effort. So, you can download it. I'll put the link in the description. I had told you that HTML is the body of a car. The roof of a car is the body of a car. So, CSS is the paint, decoration, designs, seeds, interior, all these things. And JavaScript is Engine and internal logic. Anyway, we'll talk about Engine and internal logic later. We've completed HTML. Now, we'll talk about CSS. I'll tell you some more examples. Like, your human body has a skeleton. You can consider it as HTML. It has a skin, it has hair. You can consider it as CSS. And the brain, nerves, neurons, they all constitute JavaScript. I hope this is clear to you. So, HTML was never intended to style websites. This is what CSS took responsibility for. CSS said, HTML is enough for you. Now, I'm here. And I'll help you in styling. So, CSS took responsibility for styling pages. So, download the HTML notes. Anyway, spoiler alert. CSS notes are also very important. But listen to me first. I've already given you the spoiler. But don't download it now. I've taken a lot of time and effort to do this. So, there are many things to be found. And I've never made a course of this level. This is the whole thing. So, if I click Shift and open with code, then this video 14 folder is opened in my VS code. Now, I've made an HTML file. And I've marked the exclamation mark. And I've made a boilerplate code. As we were doing our HTML course. We can do it like HTML videos. And I'll write CSS in the title. And I'll write a div in the body. Hey, I am Harry. And today, I am in CSS mode. Okay, I've written it. And I'll preview it. So, as soon as I click on preview, you can see, hey, I am Harry. And today, I am in CSS mode. So, what is CSS? You can add CSS by using style tag. There are two other ways. I'll tell you in the upcoming videos. I'll tell you a lot of things. Now, if I say, look, the div is, the div is, color it red. I'll say this. I said, color the div red. So, in this div, what is this? This is the selector. And this is our declaration. So, selector and declaration. What is selector? It is the div. That is, all the divs of this page. Color it. Which is our key. This is our property. This is the value of that property. Red the color. Okay, so this is our declaration. And this is our selector. I hope you understood. So, here, I'll show you the page. See, its color is red. Because I said, whatever is the div in this page, color it red. Okay, so if I make another div here, and write, I am good, then that I am good color will be ready. As you can see. And if I add another declaration in this. And I write, background yellow. So, here, its background is yellow. Its background is also yellow. Whatever matches this selector, that element's background will be yellow. Like you see here, I said, div. And here, this was the div. And here, this was the div. If I make a span here, and I write, I am also good. Okay, so what will happen? Will this also be red? No, its color will not be red. Because this selector, and these declarations are not applicable on these elements. Okay, any element which is not div. Okay, if I add a paragraph here. And here, add Lorem 435. Oops, I think 435 is too much. 43 is enough. Okay, so here, I have added a very big Lorem. Which will make our page very big. In this, the declaration that we have made, in this, this declaration was not applicable. It was not applicable in this too. I had only said div. So, all these conditions have been applied in div. Now, by adding comma here, I can select multiple elements. I can say, do this in divorce pan. So, divorce pan will be red in both. And here, background color will be yellow. Divorce pan is my selector. So, I have applied these declarations in multiple selectors. Here, property, background color is a property. Its value is yellow. Color is a property whose value is red. Okay, here you can see, wherever it will be div, wherever it will be span, this thing will be lagged. And that's pretty much how CSS works. That's it. What we will learn in the coming videos, that this is from property and this is from selector. I will tell you about selectors in different ways. That's about it. As simple as that. And by using these selectors, we can make a website like Amazon, Flipkart, Facebook, and Instagram. We can make all these. And nowadays, there are such technologies in the market, which you can code like this and make mobile apps. We will explore all these things. It will be a very extensive course. It will be fun. We will be touching so many things. I have given you an exercise in video number 12. If you haven't posted your answer, please do post your answer. Because I will give a shout out to those who will post their answer in the comment section. Make sure that you go to video 12 and solve the pure HTML player's exercise. Because there will be two interactions, it will be fun. I will talk from both sides. From here, I will give you a shout out. You will solve it. It will be fun. I want to tell you about the replete. Many people say that we have a phone. We don't have a laptop. There are many problems. You can try out the replete. You just have to sign up here and you will be able to write HTML, CSN, JavaScript. It works very well. I have used it for my production and great projects. I have made a lot of videos on replete on this channel. We have done 100 days of code in the replete. You can use it. You can do it. Write in the comment section whether it is fun or not. I want everyone to comment whether it is fun or not. Make sure to access this playlist. Access the source code. I have updated the source code of all the videos. And name the land of my village and town. That's all for now. Thank you so much for watching this video. I will see you next time. Bye."
