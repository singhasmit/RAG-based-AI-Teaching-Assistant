And if you haven't accessed the code, then all the data of the GitHub is updated to video 11. And I will keep updating as the videos will continue. Now, for the question I want to give you, I will make a folder first. I will definitely name the folder. I will click on the video 12, shift right click and open with code. And everyone should accept this challenge. If you accept it, I will feel good. What you do here is that I will make an index.html here. And I will give you a question. So the question is, you are given 12 video files. 12 files, 6 audio and 6 video. And 6 video. Design a website using HTML only. And which shows these 12 files. Okay, I will do a little toggle word wrap here. So that you can see the word wrap. So what you have to do is that you are given 12 files. And what is the name of those files? 1.mp3, 2.mp3. So I will tell you what is the name of those files? 1.mp3, 2.mp3. All the way till 6.mp3. So these are your files. Then you have 1.mp4, 2.mp4. All the way till 6.mp4. Okay, these are your files. So all these files, which are 12 files, you have to show by preview. So I hope this will be done. It is a very simple question. And you all should quickly comment and write the challenge accepted. Because if you accept this challenge, then you can write the challenge accepted in the first instance. And whoever gives me the code here, I will give a shout out to them. The person who writes the challenge accepted will get a shout out for sure. And you all should definitely tell me in the comment section. So I hope you will complete this. And it is a very simple question. I know that many people will also say that it is very simple. One more thing I will hope from you all is that you all should try to solve this question in the most useful way that I have told you. So this was the question of today. I hope you all enjoyed it. I will select it and forward it. And what happens if you do it? That you can comment or uncomment. So if you press control forward slash, then it will be uncommented. And if you press control forward slash again, then it will be commented. So you have to complete this website. It is a very simple problem. It is a straightforward problem. Everyone should definitely solve it. So that's all for now. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Music"
