  "text": " In this video, I will tell you what are ID and classes. The concept of ID and classes is one of the concepts that are confused. In fact, when I was learning HTML in my early days, I was confused in the ID and classes. ID means unique identifier. If you give an ID to an element, you will not give it to another element. But the meaning of the class is that if you want to give multiple elements to a property, you will give it multiple classes. For example, you can give a class called red, a div, and a form. Similarly, you can give an article and header tag of BG Red Nam class. Do like this video because we will go into the computer screen and we will see these things very closely. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, I am back. If you have not accessed the Sigma Web Development codes, then access the playlist. Click here and save the file. And the source code is also being uploaded on GitHub. Now I will come here in the folder and make a folder of video number 9. I will make a folder of video 9. I will write video 9 and after making a folder of video 9, I will shift right click and open with code. And here you can see that this is open in BS code. I will write index.html here. I will put exclamation mark and enter. And now I will tell you what are ID and classes. You will have a basic card or not. If you do not have any ID, then you will have no ID. Now do not write in the comments that I do not have ID. Whenever you go to any place, you have to show ID. In some of the cases, to prove your identity. Here I am. Now if you want to understand ID and classes in the restaurant, then ID is your identity. Okay, what is your identity? So listen to a story here. This is John and this is Harry. These are very good friends. They are very good friends. They do not share their lunch and the rest are good friends. They are not in the matter of food and they are friends in other matters. Now you can see that John and Harry have their own ID. So this is my ID and John's ID looks like this. So this is John's ID and this is my ID. Both of us can never have the same ID. Or if you consider that our friendship is made, then my friendship is made. Tania and John's friendship is made, then start. So their ID will also be different. And this is Tania's ID. This is Tania's ID. Now, each person's ID will be different. So John and Harry were friends. John's friend was made. This is Tania's ID. None of these four have the same ID. If you know any of these four ID, you will understand that Harry is the number 35, 34, 35, and 35. And if I say that John will be the number 35, 35, 36, and 35, then you will understand that Tania is the number 35. So this is uniquely identified. This is the number, Tania, Harry, Shruti, and John. So this is their ID and this is their ID. This number will not be found by anyone else. Along with that, John and Harry were childhood friends. They were both big and one class. And the name of that class was class 10. Both of them are in class 10. Listen to me. Listen to me. And Shruti is in class 9. And Tania is in class 9. So both are in class 9. Tania is in class 9 and Shruti is in class 9. So what is Shruti's class 9? Tania's class can be 9. Now, Shruti will not have to study alone in class. Or Harry will not have to study alone in class 10. And there are other kids in class. So the meaning of class is that Harry and John are in one class. So can a class be a multiple of one person? A class can be a multiple of one person. For example, Malo, Harry is in class 10. And this goes into a tuition where this class is in class 10A. Malo's tuition also has classes. So more than one class can be. One is class 10. And one is class 10A. And along with that, Malo wears a red T-shirt. So his class is red too. So the class doesn't mean that he is going to study. The class means that he is classified in this class. Now come here. Leave this John, Harry, Shruti. Okay, delete this. I will zoom out and delete it. It doesn't mean anything here. Now come to index.htm and understand this. Malo, I have made a div here. And I have given it a class red. And I have made a span. And I have given it a class red. Okay, I can give different elements to the classes I have given. Or I can give the same class. But if I want to add an ID in any element. Malo, I have added an ID. His first div. I can add anything in the ID. So this is the idea. I don't give any other element. Because this is the basis of this element. If he has a second div, he can't add it. Then I will have to add something else. Okay, I have added a second div. And here I write a second and here I write a first. Okay. So this idea and the concept of classes. I personally don't know. I understood it very late. When I was learning about web development in my early days. I didn't tell anyone that ID unilkly identifies an element. And the class is It can also add multiple classes in one element. And it can also add one class in multiple elements. You understand? Like if I give it a red class. I can give it a BGLO class. Okay, BGLO. I can give it a class. And if we give a class multiple elements. Then we put a space. Like if I want to add multiple classes in this element. Then what will I do? First I will write red here. Then I will put a space and write BGLO. So in this way I can give multiple classes. Same element. Can I give the same element multiple ID? Have you ever heard of someone's two-a-thar cards? I don't know if anyone made it or not. But it's not an ideality. The number of a-thar is one person. And the number of a-thar is different from a person. Okay? One person can't have multiple. Different people can't have the same. But the class. If I say that you wear a t-shirt. Or you can wear a red t-shirt. No problem. If you go on the road. And let us say you like mango. Or you like banana. Or you like grapes. You will get multiple people. So consider that in banana class. Or that is in grapes class. Okay? Mango class. So we can classify in one class. And we can give one class to different elements. So I hope you understood this. Now I will write CSS here. And don't say that you are not studying CSS. What am I writing in CSS? You guys, I mean, I think I am writing some alien language. Okay? In style. But I am trying to make a point. I will click here. And here its preview is looking like this. First or second. I will show you one thing. One is class. How do we target in CSS? We will dot. Dot red means red class. And hash first div means. Hash means ID. Dot means class. Okay? If I say that the first div. Color the background of it red. Okay? So if you color the background of first div. It will be red. Okay? These are the selectors in CSS. And now I don't want to confuse you. And I can comment like this in CSS. Okay? But we will read all these things. Now what will I do by dot red? I will write background color red. And what will I do in dot BGL? Dot BGL will be my dot. I have to put dot. Dot means class. It means class BGL. And I will yellow the background color. Sorry, I will color it. I will not color the background color. Dot red means color is red. Look, its color is red. And the background color is yellow. So you can use ID and classes in CSS like this. I hope you have understood something. Now one thing that you have to note here is that the ID and classes are attributes of the element. This is ID attribute and this is class attribute. So what are the ID classes? Are they elements or not? They are the attributes of elements. Now there is one more use of ID. I will tell you what is the use of ID. If I take you to Wikipedia and write the coding. So this page of Wikipedia. I will go to some other page on some other page. So you can see that when you go to any page on Wikipedia. So what can you do? You can take the link of that particular place. I will show you how it is. I go to some other page. I scroll down. And here I will inspect the ID of this. This is the ID of this. Okay. So I will copy this ID. Okay. And if I put here the hashtag and this ID. Now I will enter. So it will directly bring me here. In ICDA 8. So you see if I put it in incognito. It will show me that particular ID by scrolling. You see it will scroll. Instead of showing me this. It will scroll and show me. Because it wants to bring me to this ID. So it works in linking. So that is the ID. Okay. Keep this in mind. You will know a lot of people. That you can generate links. If you write an ID in any of the links. When you open that link. Then you will see the same ID. Like it is giving me in this case. You can see that as soon as I am entering. So maybe I have wronged the ID here. But you got the point. You got the point. So it is 29.29. And I will enter it. So you see I have come down. I will open incognito. Or reload it. So you see I have come down. I will scroll it up. And after that I will open a new tab. And if I do this. See I am scrolling and bringing it on the same page. This ID on which page. So I hope you have understood the ID and the classes. From the video's medium. The ID is like a half card. Class means that one person's property. Like he likes red. Or which class he is in. You can give multiple classes to one element. One element can be of red color. And its background can be yellow. And the other element can be of red and background yellow. So red class can be put on multiple elements. You can put red class on fake element. And in one element you can put red class. And you can put BG yellow class. So I hope you have understood. So for now this is the end of this video. I was reading captions and I got laughing. I was reading captions. So I told him that the land of the village is my name. And I heard this thing and laughed 5-10 times. It was very tasty. I said to access name your village land. My name. So on that, access playlist. Access GitHub too. Like the video. Write the hashtag sigma batch op in the comment section. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. ."
