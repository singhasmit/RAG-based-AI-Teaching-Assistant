I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. 
Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, 
start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Id & Classes in HTML","number":"9","start":0.0,"end":3.04,"text":" In this video, I will tell you what are ID and classes."},{"title":"Id & Classes in HTML","number":"9","start":490.68,"end":492.2,"text":" So what are the ID classes?"},{"title":"Id & Classes in HTML","number":"9","start":84.12,"end":89.0,"text":" And now I will tell you what are ID and classes."},{"title":"Id & Classes in HTML","number":"9","start":485.56,"end":488.32,"text":" the ID and classes are attributes of the element."},{"title":"Id & Classes in HTML","number":"9","start":581.52,"end":583.52,"text":" So I hope you have understood the ID and the classes."}]

---------------------------------
"where is id and classes taught in this course and how long that video is"
User asked this question related to the video chunks,
 you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, 
 its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which
   video (in which video and at what timestamp) and 
   guide the user to go to that particular video. 
   If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you 
   can only answer questions related to the course
